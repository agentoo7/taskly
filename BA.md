‚è∫ Perfect! Let's dive into this brainstorming session about building a Trello-like application with full features.

  I have a few questions to help shape our session:

  1. Are there any constraints or parameters I should know about? (e.g., specific technology stack, timeline, budget, team size,
  target users, must-have features, etc.)

  2. What's your goal for this session - broad exploration or focused ideation? (Are we exploring all possibilities widely, or
  focusing on specific aspects of the app?)

  3. Would you like a structured document output to reference later? (Default: Yes - this will capture all our ideas, insights, and
  action items in an organized format)

‚è∫ Excellent choices! We'll use:
  1. What If Scenarios (Creative Expansion)
  2. Five Whys (Deep Exploration)
  3. Role Playing (Advanced - Stakeholder Perspectives)

  Let's start with What If Scenarios to warm up and explore possibilities broadly.


  ---
  üéØ Technique 1: What If Scenarios

  This technique helps us explore bold possibilities for your Trello-like application. I'll ask provocative "what if" questions, and
  you share whatever comes to mind - no filtering, just exploring!

  Let's begin:

  What if your Trello-like app could predict what tasks users need to create before they even think of them?

  What possibilities does that open up? What features or capabilities would that require?

> suggest me the best features 

‚è∫ I appreciate you want suggestions, but as your facilitator, my role is to help you discover the best ideas! Let me guide you through
   this.

  For the question: "What if your app could predict tasks before users create them?"

  Let me give you a couple of starter examples to spark your thinking:

  - AI-powered task suggestions based on project patterns (e.g., "You usually create a 'Review' task after 'Development' - want me to
  create it?")
  - Smart templates that learn from your workflow and auto-populate boards

  Now, building on those or thinking completely differently:

  Your turn:
  - What patterns could your app detect from user behavior?
  - What data would make predictions useful vs. annoying?
  - How would this change the user experience of creating boards and tasks?
  - What's one feature that would make YOU say "wow, this saves me time"?

  Give me 2-3 ideas that come to mind - they don't need to be perfect, just whatever pops into your head!


> User will manualy add task, we do not need ai suggest task 

‚è∫ Perfect! That's a clear decision - manual task creation, no AI suggestions. Got it!

  Let me ask a different "What If" question that's more aligned with your vision:

  ---
  What if your Trello-like app made collaboration feel as seamless as working on a shared whiteboard in the same room?

  Think about:
  - How do people communicate around tasks?
  - How do you eliminate the friction of "is this updated?" or "who's working on what?"
  - What would make remote teams feel more connected?
  - What real-time features would create that "in the same room" feeling?

  Share 2-4 ideas that would make collaboration feel seamless and natural in your app!

> This is use for software develop, no need realtime 

‚è∫ Got it! So we're focusing on:
  - Software development use case
  - Manual task management
  - No real-time collaboration requirements

  Let me ask a more relevant "What If" question:

  ---
  What if your app could make software development workflows (sprints, backlogs, releases) easier to manage than Trello currently 
  does?

  Think about what frustrates developers using Trello for software projects:
  - How would you organize backlogs, sprints, and releases?
  - What views would developers actually want? (Kanban, timeline, calendar, dependencies?)
  - What metadata matters for dev tasks? (story points, priority, labels, branches, PRs?)
  - How would you handle recurring dev workflows (code review, testing, deployment)?

  Give me 3-5 features or improvements that would make this better for software development than standard Trello!

  > - views: Kanban, timeline and calendar, - metadata: all major 

‚è∫ Excellent! I'm capturing these:

  ‚úÖ Views: Kanban, Timeline, Calendar
  ‚úÖ Metadata: All major (story points, priority, labels, assignments, dates, etc.)

  Now let me push you a bit further on this:

  What if switching between those 3 views (Kanban/Timeline/Calendar) could reveal insights you can't see in just one view?

  For example:
  - What would you want to SEE in timeline view that helps with planning?
  - What would calendar view show that Kanban doesn't?
  - How would filters/groupings work across these views?

  Give me 2-3 specific scenarios where switching views would help you manage a software project better.

  For example: "In timeline view, I could see that Sprint 3 has too many tasks compared to Sprint 2, so I'd rebalance them..."

  Your turn - what scenarios come to mind?

> - Balancing workloads across sprints 

‚è∫ Great! Balancing workloads across sprints - that's a key use case.

  So in your app:
  - Timeline view would show all sprints side-by-side
  - You could see task density/story points per sprint
  - Drag tasks between sprints to rebalance

  Quick follow-up - give me 1-2 more scenarios:

  What other problems would these view-switches solve?
  - Resource allocation? (Who's overloaded?)
  - Deadline management? (What's at risk?)
  - Dependency tracking? (What's blocking what?)
  - Release planning? (What ships when?)

  Just give me 1 or 2 more quick scenarios where switching views helps you manage better, then we'll move to the next What If
  question!

> Scenario 1: Workload Balancing Across Team Members

Kanban view: Shows which team members have too many ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù tasks.

Timeline view: Reveals overlapping assignments and who‚Äôs overbooked during certain sprints.

Calendar view: Helps visualize time off or holidays that might affect availability.
‚Üí Insight: Switching views helps you quickly rebalance tasks or redistribute workload before burnout happens.

üí° Scenario 2: Release Coordination and Risk Tracking

Timeline view: Highlights which features are tied to upcoming releases and their completion status.

Calendar view: Shows release milestones and deadlines.

Kanban view: Lets you drill into blockers or incomplete stories that threaten a release.
‚Üí Insight: Switching views helps you spot release risks early and adjust priorities or deadlines proactively. 

‚è∫ Fantastic! These are really well-thought-out scenarios! I love how you've mapped specific insights to each view:

  ‚úÖ Scenario 1: Workload Balancing - Prevent burnout by visualizing capacity across views
  ‚úÖ Scenario 2: Release Coordination - Spot risks early and adjust proactively

  I'm capturing all of this for your document. Now let's explore another dimension:

  ---
  Next "What If" Question:

  What if your app could make the "boring but necessary" parts of project management actually enjoyable (or at least painless)?

  Think about the stuff people hate about project tools:
  - Setting up new projects/boards
  - Keeping things organized and consistent
  - Status updates and reporting
  - Moving tasks through workflows
  - Maintaining metadata (tags, priorities, etc.)

  What's 2-3 things your app could do to make these tedious activities faster, easier, or even enjoyable?

  (Think: templates, bulk actions, shortcuts, smart defaults, automation, drag-and-drop magic...)

  > ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Smart Project Templates

When you start a new project, the app could suggest auto-generated board templates based on past projects or your team‚Äôs patterns 
(e.g., ‚ÄúSprint Board,‚Äù ‚ÄúMarketing Launch,‚Äù ‚ÄúBug Fix Cycle‚Äù). 

‚ö° 2. Bulk Actions + Drag-and-Drop Magic

Let users drag multiple tasks at once to assign people, change priorities, or move between stages.

ü§ñ 3. Auto Status + Smart Summaries

Instead of writing boring updates, the app could auto-generate sprint summaries or status reports from activity data (completed tasks,
 commits, comments). 

‚è∫ Excellent! You're really hitting your stride now! These are practical and user-focused:

  ‚úÖ Smart Project Templates - Accelerate setup with context-aware templates
  ‚úÖ Bulk Actions + Drag-and-Drop Magic - Multi-select efficiency
  ‚úÖ Auto Status + Smart Summaries - Generate reports from activity data

  I love how #3 uses automation intelligently without forcing AI suggestions on users. The data is already there - just summarize it!

  ---
  One More "What If" to Push the Envelope:

  What if your Trello-like app had ONE killer feature that made developers say "I can't go back to regular Trello"?

  This is your competitive edge - the thing that makes your app a must-have.

  Looking at what we've discussed (multi-views, workload balancing, bulk actions, dev-focused metadata):

  What's the ONE feature or capability that would be your app's signature move?

  Think big - what would make you tell every developer friend "You HAVE to try this app"?

> üß≤ Signature Move: ‚ÄúMove a Card, Ship the Code‚Äù (Git-Native Autopilot Board)

A Trello-simple board that‚Äôs live-linked to your repo, CI, and calendar. When you drag a card, the whole dev pipeline updates itself.

What it does (auto-magic):

Drag ‚Üí Branch/PR/Env: Moving a card to In Progress auto-creates a branch (naming convention), scaffold commits, and a PR with 
templates; to Review assigns reviewers; to QA spins a preview env; to Done merges behind a protected rule.

Autostatus from signals: Card status, estimates, and risk update from commits, CI runs, test coverage, and release tags‚Äîno manual 
reporting.

Live Dependency Graph: Cards know what code/modules they touch; blockers surface automatically. Drag to reorder and it rewires 
dependencies/sprint timelines with impact analysis.

One-gesture bulk ops: Lasso multiple cards to batch-assign owners, labels, due dates‚Äîor generate sub-tasks from PR diffs/tests.

Release-aware timeline: Milestones and cut dates sync to calendars; slipping tests/PRs auto-flag release risk.

Why devs say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go back‚Äù:
Because the board isn‚Äôt a to-do list‚Äîit‚Äôs the control surface for your repo. You organize visually, and the app does the boring glue 
work: branches, PRs, reviewers, environments, reports‚Äîdone the moment you move a card. 

‚è∫ üéØ BOOM! Now THAT'S a killer feature!

  This is genuinely differentiated and solves real developer pain. Let me highlight why this is so strong:

  ‚úÖ "Control surface for your repo" - Perfect metaphor. You're not managing tasks, you're orchestrating the entire dev lifecycle

  ‚úÖ Eliminates ceremony - Branch creation, PR templates, reviewer assignment, environment provisioning - all automated by card
  movement

  ‚úÖ Bidirectional sync - Not just board‚ÜíGit, but Git/CI‚Üíboard (commits, tests, coverage update card status automatically)

  ‚úÖ Dependency intelligence - Cards understand code relationships and surface blockers without manual entry

  ‚úÖ Visual + Powerful - Keeps Trello's simplicity but adds dev workflow superpowers

  The tagline "Move a Card, Ship the Code" perfectly captures the value prop!

  Great work with What If Scenarios! We've generated some excellent ideas.

  Ready to switch techniques? Let's move to Five Whys to dig deeper into the motivations behind your vision.

  Or would you like to explore one more What If scenario first?

  (Type "next" to move to Five Whys, or suggest another What If question)


> next 

‚è∫ Perfect! Let's move to Technique 2: Five Whys üîç

  This technique helps us understand the deeper motivations and root causes behind your vision. I'll ask "why" questions to dig
  beneath the surface.

  ---
  üîç Five Whys: Understanding Your Core Motivation

  Let's start with your killer feature - the "Git-Native Autopilot Board."

  Question 1:
  Why do you want to build a project management tool that's deeply integrated with Git/CI/CD workflows?

  (What problem or frustration is this really solving for you or your team?)

> yes 

‚è∫ I need you to share your reasoning - let me rephrase:

  What frustration or pain point are you experiencing (or have experienced) that makes you want to build this Git-integrated project
  management tool?

  For example:
  - "I'm tired of updating both Trello AND GitHub..."
  - "My team wastes time on manual status updates..."
  - "We lose track of what code relates to which task..."

  Tell me in your own words: What problem does this solve for you or developers you know?

> 1 and 2 

‚è∫ Great! So the core frustrations are:

  ‚úÖ Tired of updating both Trello AND GitHub (double entry, context switching)
  ‚úÖ Team wastes time on manual status updates (busy work that doesn't add value)

  ---
  Question 2 (Why):

  Why is this double-entry and manual updating such a big problem?

  What's the real impact on you or your team?
  - Does it slow down delivery?
  - Does information get out of sync?
  - Does it kill momentum/focus?
  - Does it create visibility gaps for stakeholders?

  What actually happens when people have to maintain two systems and manually update status?

> oh no, my mistake, I mean 1 and 3 

‚è∫ Ah, got it! So the core frustrations are:

  ‚úÖ Tired of updating both Trello AND GitHub (double entry, context switching)
  ‚úÖ Lose track of what code relates to which task (traceability problem)

  ---
  Question 2 (Why):

  Why is losing track of the code-to-task relationship such a problem?

  What actually goes wrong when you can't easily see which code/branches/PRs relate to which tasks?
  - Hard to review code in context?
  - Difficult to troubleshoot or rollback issues?
  - Can't measure actual progress vs. board status?
  - Slows down onboarding or handoffs?

  Tell me what pain this causes in real development work!

> Hard to review code 

‚è∫ Perfect! So:

  ‚úÖ Hard to review code when you can't see the task context

  ---
  Question 3 (Why):

  Why does difficult code review matter so much?

  What's the downstream impact?
  - Bugs slip through?
  - Reviews take longer than they should?
  - Reviewers lack context to give good feedback?
  - Quality suffers?

  What's at stake when code reviews are harder than they need to be?

> - Reviewers lack context to give good feedback? 

‚è∫ Excellent! So the chain is forming:

  ‚úÖ Reviewers lack context to give good feedback

  ---
  Question 4 (Why):

  Why is lacking context for good feedback such a critical issue?

  What happens when reviewers can't give informed, contextual feedback?
  - Code doesn't align with the actual requirement?
  - Architectural decisions get questioned/redone?
  - Security or edge cases get missed?
  - Team knowledge stays siloed?

  What's the real consequence of reviewers operating without full context?

> - Code doesn't align with the actual requirement? 

‚è∫ Perfect! The chain is deepening:

  ‚úÖ Code doesn't align with the actual requirement

  ---
  Question 5 (Final Why):

  Why is misalignment between code and requirements the ultimate problem?

  What's the final impact on the business/product/team?
  - Wasted developer time on rework?
  - Delayed releases?
  - Customer dissatisfaction?
  - Technical debt accumulates?
  - Team morale suffers from redoing work?

  What's the ROOT consequence that makes all of this matter? Why does this chain of problems ultimately hurt?

> - Wasted developer time on rework? 

‚è∫ Excellent! We've reached the root cause. Let me trace the full chain:

  ---
  üîç Five Whys - Complete Chain:

  1. Why build this? ‚Üí Double entry between tools + lose track of code-to-task links
  2. Why is losing track a problem? ‚Üí Hard to review code
  3. Why does difficult review matter? ‚Üí Reviewers lack context to give good feedback
  4. Why is lacking context critical? ‚Üí Code doesn't align with actual requirements
  5. Why is misalignment the ultimate problem? ‚Üí Wasted developer time on rework

  ---
  üí° Root Insight: Your app is fundamentally about protecting developer time from being wasted on preventable rework. By connecting
  the board to the repo, you're ensuring reviewers have context, which ensures code meets requirements the first time, which
  eliminates costly rework.

  This is gold! It clarifies your true value proposition: "Stop wasting developer time on preventable rework."

  ---
  Ready for the final technique? Let's move to Role Playing to explore your app from different stakeholder perspectives!

  Type "next" when ready!


> next 

‚è∫ Perfect! Let's move to Technique 3: Role Playing üé≠

  This technique helps us see your app through different eyes. We'll brainstorm from various stakeholder perspectives to uncover
  needs, pain points, and opportunities you might miss from just one viewpoint.

  ---
  üé≠ Role Playing: Stakeholder Perspectives

  For your Git-native project management app, here are key stakeholders:

  Select 2-3 roles to explore (type the numbers):

  1. Individual Developer - Writing code, creating branches, submitting PRs
  2. Tech Lead / Engineering Manager - Overseeing team, planning sprints, removing blockers
  3. Product Manager - Defining requirements, tracking progress, release planning
  4. QA/Test Engineer - Testing features, reporting bugs, verifying fixes
  5. DevOps Engineer - Managing environments, CI/CD pipelines, deployments
  6. CTO/VP Engineering - High-level visibility, resource allocation, strategic decisions
  7. New Team Member - Onboarding, learning the codebase, understanding workflow
  8. External Stakeholder/Client - Checking progress, understanding what's being built

  Which 2-3 perspectives would give us the most valuable insights?

> 1 

‚è∫ Great! Individual Developer - the person in the trenches writing code daily.

  You only selected one role. Would you like to add 1-2 more perspectives for richer insights?

  (Exploring multiple viewpoints often reveals conflicts or complementary needs - e.g., what a developer wants vs. what a manager
  needs)

  Type:
  - Another number (or two) to add more roles, OR
  - "just 1" if you want to focus only on the Developer perspective

> all 

‚è∫ Excellent! All 8 perspectives - this will give us comprehensive coverage of your app's ecosystem. Let's explore each role
  systematically.

  ---
  üé≠ Role 1: Individual Developer

  Put yourself in their shoes: You're a developer who codes daily, creates branches, submits PRs, and moves through the development
  workflow.

  From this perspective, answer:

  1. What would make your daily workflow smoother with this app?
  2. What would frustrate you or slow you down?
  3. What's the ONE thing this app must get right for you to use it every day?

  Give me 2-4 thoughts from the Developer's perspective!

> üß© 1. What would make my daily workflow smoother

Fast context switching ‚Äî I can jump from Kanban ‚Üí Timeline ‚Üí Code view without losing filters or scroll position.

Smart automation ‚Äî things like auto-assigning reviewers, syncing Git commits to tasks, or generating changelogs automatically.

Keyboard-first commands ‚Äî quick actions (e.g., ‚Äú‚åò+K ‚Üí new story‚Äù) make me feel in control instead of clicking endlessly.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. What would frustrate or slow me down

Lag or reloads between views ‚Äî I lose focus if switching from Timeline to Kanban takes more than a second.

Overcomplicated UI ‚Äî too many panels or options when I just want to update a ticket.

Poor integration with Git or IDE ‚Äî if I have to copy-paste issue links manually, I‚Äôll stop using it.

üöÄ 3. The ONE thing it must get right

‚ÄúStay perfectly in sync with my code.‚Äù
If the app always reflects the real state of the repo (commits, branches, PRs, deployments), I‚Äôll trust it and live in it daily. 

‚è∫ Fantastic perspective! The Developer needs:

  ‚úÖ Fast context switching with preserved state (filters, scroll position)
  ‚úÖ Smart automation (reviewers, Git sync, changelogs)
  ‚úÖ Keyboard-first commands (‚åò+K quick actions)
  ‚úÖ No lag between views (< 1 second transitions)
  ‚úÖ Simple UI without clutter
  ‚úÖ Seamless Git/IDE integration (no copy-paste)
  ‚úÖ THE ONE THING: Perfect sync with repo state = trust

  ---
  üé≠ Role 2: Tech Lead / Engineering Manager

  Now switch perspectives: You're managing a team, planning sprints, removing blockers, and ensuring delivery.

  From this perspective, answer:

  1. What visibility do you need that you don't get from typical tools?
  2. What would help you make better decisions about resource allocation and priorities?
  3. What reports or insights would make your life easier?

  Give me 2-4 thoughts from the Tech Lead's perspective!

> üëÄ 1. What visibility I don‚Äôt get from typical tools

Real-time workload clarity ‚Äî who‚Äôs overloaded, who‚Äôs underutilized, and where hidden blockers are forming.

Dependency heatmaps ‚Äî what tasks or teams are blocking others, not just statuses on a Kanban board.

Delivery confidence ‚Äî predictive signals showing which sprints or features are at risk before it‚Äôs too late.

üß≠ 2. What would help me make better decisions

Effort vs. impact dashboards ‚Äî see where time is going versus which features actually move metrics.

Unified resource view ‚Äî combine developer availability, velocity, and skill match in one place when planning sprints.

‚ÄúWhat-if‚Äù planning mode ‚Äî simulate reassigning tasks or shifting deadlines to see how it affects delivery.

üìä 3. Reports or insights that would make my life easier

Weekly auto-summaries of progress, blockers, and risk across all projects (ready to share in stand-ups or exec syncs).

Quality trend reports ‚Äî link test coverage, bug count, and deployment frequency so I can see if velocity is hurting quality.

People insights ‚Äî signals about burnout risk or context-switch overload based on activity patterns. 

‚è∫ Outstanding insights! The Tech Lead needs:

  ‚úÖ Real-time workload clarity (overloaded/underutilized team members)
  ‚úÖ Dependency heatmaps (what's blocking what)
  ‚úÖ Delivery confidence signals (predictive risk indicators)
  ‚úÖ Effort vs. impact dashboards (time spent vs. value delivered)
  ‚úÖ Unified resource view (availability, velocity, skills)
  ‚úÖ "What-if" planning mode (simulate reassignments/deadline shifts)
  ‚úÖ Weekly auto-summaries (ready for stand-ups/exec syncs)
  ‚úÖ Quality trend reports (coverage, bugs, deployment frequency)
  ‚úÖ People insights (burnout risk, context-switch overload)

  ---
  üé≠ Role 3: Product Manager

  Switch perspectives again: You're defining requirements, tracking feature progress, planning releases, and communicating with
  stakeholders.

  From this perspective, answer:

  1. What information do you need to keep stakeholders informed?
  2. How would you want to manage roadmap and release planning?
  3. What would help you make trade-off decisions (scope vs. timeline)?

  Give me 2-4 thoughts from the Product Manager's perspective!

> üì¢ 1. Information I need to keep stakeholders informed

Single-source status view ‚Äî a live snapshot showing progress, risks, and upcoming milestones across all features.

Outcome-based updates ‚Äî not just ‚Äúdone/not done,‚Äù but ‚Äúwhat value shipped‚Äù (metrics, adoption, user impact).

Automatic stakeholder reports ‚Äî weekly digests summarizing delivery progress, blockers, and key decisions in plain language.

üó∫Ô∏è 2. How I‚Äôd want to manage roadmap and releases

Drag-and-drop roadmap view ‚Äî instantly see dependencies, deadlines, and release scope.

Link features to goals ‚Äî every initiative tied to a measurable KPI or OKR, so prioritization isn‚Äôt guesswork.

Scenario planning ‚Äî simulate ‚Äúwhat happens if this slips?‚Äù to adjust timelines or re-scope intelligently.

‚öñÔ∏è 3. What would help me make trade-off decisions

Effort-to-impact visualization ‚Äî if I cut scope by 20%, what‚Äôs the real effect on user value or deadlines?

Cross-team dependency view ‚Äî understanding how one feature‚Äôs delay affects others before deciding what to drop.

Confidence scores ‚Äî based on delivery data, showing which features are low-risk vs. high-uncertainty. 

‚è∫ Excellent PM perspective! Product Managers need:

  ‚úÖ Single-source status view (live progress, risks, milestones)
  ‚úÖ Outcome-based updates (value shipped, not just completion)
  ‚úÖ Automatic stakeholder reports (weekly digests in plain language)
  ‚úÖ Drag-and-drop roadmap (dependencies, deadlines, scope)
  ‚úÖ Link features to goals (KPIs/OKRs for prioritization)
  ‚úÖ Scenario planning ("what if this slips?")
  ‚úÖ Effort-to-impact visualization (scope cuts vs. user value)
  ‚úÖ Cross-team dependency view (ripple effects)
  ‚úÖ Confidence scores (low-risk vs. high-uncertainty features)

  ---
  üé≠ Role 4: QA/Test Engineer

  Now become the tester: You're responsible for validating features, catching bugs, and ensuring quality before release.

  From this perspective, answer:

  1. What information do you need to test effectively?
  2. How would you track bugs and their relationship to features/code?
  3. What would help you prevent bottlenecks in the testing phase?

  Give me 2-4 thoughts from the QA Engineer's perspective!

> üîç 1. Information I need to test effectively

Clear acceptance criteria per story ‚Äî written in Given-When-Then format or equivalent, so I know exactly what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means.

  Executive Summary (Draft)

  Taskly is a Git-native project management application that eliminates wasted developer time by seamlessly synchronizing visual task
  boards with code repositories. Unlike traditional tools like Trello that require developers to maintain separate systems for task
  tracking and code management, Taskly treats the project board as a "control surface for your repo"‚Äîwhere moving a card automatically
   triggers Git operations (branch creation, PR setup, environment provisioning) and code activity (commits, CI runs, deployments)
  updates card status in real-time.

  The primary problem being solved is preventable rework caused by context loss: when reviewers lack task context during code review,
  code misaligns with requirements, forcing costly rework cycles. Taskly solves this by maintaining bidirectional synchronization
  between tasks and code, ensuring every PR is linked to its requirement, every commit updates progress automatically, and teams never
   waste time on double-entry or manual status updates.

  Target market: Software development teams (5-50 developers) currently using tools like Trello, Jira, or Linear alongside
  GitHub/GitLab, who struggle with context switching and keeping project management tools in sync with actual code progress.

  Key value proposition: "Move a Card, Ship the Code" - developers get Trello-simple visual management with the power of automated Git
   workflows, eliminating ceremony while preserving complete task-to-code traceability.

  ---
  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Positioned as "Taskly" (proposed name) vs. describing generically - gives it identity
  - Emphasized the Git-native killer feature prominently - this is the differentiator
  - Focused on the "wasted time from rework" problem from our Five Whys - this is the root motivation
  - Called out 5-50 developer teams as sweet spot - avoids enterprise complexity, targets SMB/growth companies

  Key assumptions:
  - Teams are already using Git (GitHub/GitLab) - non-negotiable for core value prop
  - Current pain with existing tools is significant enough to switch
  - "Trello-simple" resonates as a positive comparison

  Questions for you:
  - Do you like "Taskly" as a working name, or prefer something else?
  - Is the 5-50 developer team size the right target, or do you want broader/narrower?
  - Should I mention specific competitors (Trello, Jira, Linear) or keep it more general?

     ## Executive Summary
     **Taskly** is a Git-native project management application that eliminates wasted developer time by seamlessly synchronizing

  Problem Statement (Draft)

  Current State and Pain Points

  Software development teams today operate in a fragmented workflow environment where task management and code development exist in
  separate, poorly-connected systems. Developers use visual project management tools (Trello, Jira, Linear) to organize work, but
  these tools have no meaningful integration with where the actual work happens: Git repositories, pull requests, and CI/CD pipelines.

  This fragmentation creates a cascade of problems:

  1. Double-Entry Tax
  Developers must manually update both the project board AND GitHub‚Äîmoving a Trello card to "In Progress," then creating a branch,
  then opening a PR, then updating the card again when code is submitted. This constant context-switching between tools wastes 15-30
  minutes per task, adding up to 5-10 hours per developer per week.

  2. Context Loss at Critical Moments
  When a reviewer opens a pull request, they see code changes but lack immediate access to:
  - The original requirement or user story
  - Acceptance criteria and edge cases
  - Design decisions or architectural discussions
  - Related tasks or dependencies

  Without this context, reviewers either:
  - Request information from the author (adding delay)
  - Make assumptions (leading to misaligned feedback)
  - Approve without full understanding (allowing misalignment to ship)

  3. Preventable Rework Cycles
  Our Five Whys analysis revealed the root consequence: when reviewers lack context, code doesn't align with actual requirements. This
   misalignment forces costly rework cycles‚Äîdevelopers rewriting code, retesting, re-reviewing‚Äîwasting hours or days that could have
  been prevented with better context preservation.

  4. Visibility Gaps
  Managers and stakeholders can't see real progress because project boards don't reflect actual code status. A card marked "In
  Progress" might have a stalled PR with failing tests, but the board shows green. This disconnect undermines planning and erodes
  trust in project tracking.

  Impact of the Problem

  Time waste: Conservatively, double-entry and rework consume 10-15% of developer capacity‚Äîequivalent to losing 1-2 developers on a
  team of 10.

  Quality degradation: Rushed reviews without context introduce bugs and technical debt that compound over time.

  Team friction: Constant "what's the status?" questions and misaligned expectations create frustration and communication overhead.

  Strategic cost: Leadership can't make informed decisions when project data is stale or disconnected from reality.

  Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

  Trello/Asana: Beautiful, simple boards but zero Git integration. Teams love the UX but hate the manual sync burden.

  Jira: Offers some Git linking (via plugins) but is heavyweight, slow, and optimized for enterprise process compliance rather than
  developer velocity.

  Linear/Height/Shortcut: Modern dev-focused tools with better Git integrations, but still treat the board and repo as separate
  systems requiring manual linking. They don't offer true bidirectional automation.

  GitHub Projects: Native to GitHub but limited project management capabilities‚Äîno timeline view, weak filtering, minimal metadata
  support.

  None of these tools treat the board as a "control surface" that actively manages Git workflows. They're passive tracking systems,
  not active orchestration layers.

  Urgency and Importance

  The shift to remote/distributed work has intensified these problems‚Äîteams can't walk over to ask context questions, making async
  context preservation more critical. Meanwhile, developer hiring costs and retention challenges make productivity gains from
  eliminating waste increasingly valuable. Teams that solve the "fragmented tooling" problem gain a measurable competitive advantage
  in velocity and quality.

  ---
  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Quantified time waste (10-15% capacity) - used conservative estimates to maintain credibility
  - Named specific competitors to show market awareness, but didn't over-criticize
  - Structured as a cascade (double-entry ‚Üí context loss ‚Üí rework) following our Five Whys chain
  - Emphasized the urgency in the context of remote work trends

  Key assumptions:
  - 15-30 minutes per task for double-entry is realistic (could validate with user research)
  - Reviewers lacking context is a universal pain point (validated in role-playing session)
  - Existing tools' limitations are widely recognized by target users

  Areas needing validation:
  - Actual time waste percentages (user research can quantify this)
  - Whether "control surface" metaphor resonates with target users
  - Relative importance of this problem vs. other developer pain points

       62 +  **GitHub Projects:** Native to GitHub but limited project management capabilities‚Äîno timeline view, weak filtering, 
          + minimal metadata support.
       63 +  
       64 +  None of these tools treat the board as a "control surface" that actively manages Git workflows. They're passive 
          + tracking systems, not active orchestration layers.
       65 +  
       66 +  ### Urgency and Importance
       67 +  
       68 +  The shift to remote/distributed work has intensified these problems‚Äîteams can't walk over to ask context questions, 
          + making async context preservation more critical. Meanwhile, developer hiring costs and retention challenges make 
          + productivity gains from eliminating waste increasingly valuable. Teams that solve the "fragmented tooling" problem gain
          +  a measurable competitive advantage in velocity and quality.

  Proposed Solution (Draft)

  Core Concept and Approach

  Taskly reimagines project management as active workflow orchestration rather than passive task tracking. The core innovation is
  treating the visual project board as a direct interface to Git operations‚Äîwhere dragging a card isn't just updating metadata, it's
  triggering actual development workflow steps.

  The solution has three foundational pillars:

  1. Bidirectional Git-Native Synchronization
  - Board ‚Üí Git: Moving a card to "In Progress" auto-creates a feature branch with naming conventions, scaffolds initial commit
  structure, and opens a draft PR with templates pre-filled
  - Git ‚Üí Board: Commits update card progress, CI runs update status indicators, PR reviews trigger card notifications, merges
  auto-move cards to "Done"
  - Context Preservation: Every card maintains deep links to its PRs, commits, branches, test results, and deployment status‚Äîmaking
  context instantly accessible

  2. Multi-View Intelligence System
  Three complementary views of the same data, each revealing different insights:
  - Kanban View: Traditional card-based workflow for individual developers to manage daily tasks
  - Timeline View: Sprint and release planning showing workload distribution, dependency chains, and capacity balancing across time
  - Calendar View: Deadline management, milestone tracking, and availability visualization (time off, holidays)

  Switching between views is instant (<1 second), filters and selections persist, and each view can trigger different bulk actions
  optimized for that perspective.

  3. Developer-First UX Philosophy
  - Keyboard-first commands: ‚åò+K command palette for power users who hate clicking
  - Bulk operations: Lasso multiple cards to batch-assign, update metadata, or generate sub-tasks
  - Zero-lag interface: Optimistic UI updates, background sync, sub-second view transitions
  - Smart automation without AI imposition: Auto-generate status reports from activity data, suggest reviewers based on code
  ownership, populate PR templates‚Äîbut never force AI-suggested tasks

  Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions

  vs. Trello: We preserve Trello's simplicity and visual elegance but eliminate the "dumb board" limitation‚Äîcards become live
  connections to code, not just metadata containers.

  vs. Jira: We prioritize developer velocity over enterprise process compliance. No mandatory fields, no complex workflows, no
  heavyweight administration‚Äîjust boards that work the way developers actually think.

  vs. Linear/Height: While they offer Git linking, we go further with true bidirectional automation. Their integrations are addons;
  our Git-native sync is the foundation.

  vs. GitHub Projects: We match their native Git integration but add professional project management capabilities‚Äîmultiple views, rich
   metadata, planning tools, and cross-repo coordination.

  Why This Solution Will Succeed

  1. Eliminates the Root Cause
  By preserving task-to-code context automatically, we prevent the reviewer context loss that causes misaligned code and wasted
  rework. This directly addresses the root problem identified in our Five Whys analysis.

  2. Developer Adoption Through Delight
  Developers will use Taskly daily because it feels fast‚Äîkeyboard shortcuts, instant view switching, zero lag. When tools respect
  developer time, adoption follows naturally.

  3. Manager Value Without Developer Burden
  Managers get the visibility they need (workload balancing, delivery confidence, quality trends) from activity data developers are
  already generating. No forcing developers to "update the board for reporting."

  4. Network Effects from Integration
  The tighter Taskly integrates with Git/CI/CD, the more valuable it becomes. Every commit enriches the board, every PR adds context,
  creating a flywheel of increasing utility.

  High-Level Product Vision

  Imagine a development team where:
  - A PM drags a card to "Ready for Dev" and a developer immediately sees it with full context, acceptance criteria, and design links
  - The developer drags it to "In Progress" and their branch, commit structure, and draft PR are created instantly
  - They push code and the card automatically updates with CI status, test coverage, and deployment preview links
  - A reviewer opens the PR and sees the original requirement, acceptance criteria, and dependency context inline
  - The reviewer approves, the PR merges, and the card auto-moves to "Done" while generating a release note entry
  - The manager checks the Timeline view and sees sprint capacity is balanced, no features are at risk, and the upcoming release is on
   track

  That's Taskly: A world where the board and the code are perfectly synchronized, context is never lost, and developers spend time
  building instead of updating tools.

  ---
  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Emphasized Git-native as core (not optional) - this may limit non-Git users but sharpens our positioning
  - Positioned automation as "eliminating ceremony" vs. "AI-powered intelligence" - aligns with user preference for control
  - Used specific comparison structure (vs. Trello, vs. Jira, etc.) to clarify positioning
  - Included a narrative vision scenario to make the solution tangible

  Key assumptions:
  - Git workflows (branches, PRs, CI) are universal enough across teams to build on
  - Developer delight (speed, keyboard shortcuts) drives adoption more than manager mandates
  - Teams are willing to adopt a new tool if it demonstrably saves time

  Interesting decisions:
  - Chose "active workflow orchestration" framing to differentiate from "passive tracking"
  - Made multi-view system a pillar (not just a feature) because role-playing showed each stakeholder needs different views
  - Vision scenario shows the full workflow end-to-end to illustrate value

  Target Users (Draft)

  Primary User Segment: Individual Software Developers

  Profile:
  - Software engineers, full-stack developers, frontend/backend specialists
  - Team size: 5-50 developers (small to mid-size teams)
  - Working in agile/sprint-based environments
  - Using GitHub or GitLab for version control
  - Currently frustrated with Trello, Jira, or similar tools

  Current Behaviors and Workflows:
  - Spend 5-10 hours per week manually syncing between project boards and Git
  - Create branches, PRs, and commits multiple times daily
  - Participate in code reviews regularly
  - Context-switch between 5-10 tools during a typical workday (IDE, GitHub, Slack, project board, design tools)
  - Prefer keyboard shortcuts and fast interfaces over mouse-heavy UIs

  Specific Needs and Pain Points:
  - Speed obsession: Can't tolerate lag or slow transitions between views
  - Hate double-entry: Resent updating both the board AND GitHub manually
  - Context preservation: Need instant access to task context when reviewing PRs
  - Keyboard-first workflows: Want command palettes (‚åò+K) and shortcuts for common actions
  - Trust requirements: Will only adopt tools that perfectly reflect Git reality

  Goals They're Trying to Achieve:
  - Write code and ship features efficiently without tool overhead
  - Understand requirements clearly before implementing
  - Provide thorough code reviews with full context
  - Minimize time spent on "project management busywork"
  - Stay focused and avoid constant context switching

  Why Taskly Appeals to Them:
  The Git-native sync eliminates double-entry, keyboard-first commands respect their workflows, and zero-lag performance shows the
  tool respects their time. They'll adopt because it makes their daily work genuinely faster and easier.

  ---
  Secondary User Segment: Engineering Managers & Tech Leads

  Profile:
  - Technical team leads, engineering managers, senior developers with management responsibilities
  - Managing teams of 5-20 developers
  - Responsible for sprint planning, resource allocation, and delivery
  - Report progress to senior leadership or stakeholders
  - Balance individual contribution with team management

  Current Behaviors and Workflows:
  - Plan sprints and allocate work across team members
  - Monitor progress through stand-ups, board reviews, and Git activity
  - Remove blockers and manage dependencies
  - Conduct 1:1s and monitor team health
  - Prepare status updates for executives or product stakeholders

  Specific Needs and Pain Points:
  - Visibility gaps: Can't see real workload distribution or hidden blockers
  - Manual reporting: Spend hours compiling status updates from scattered data
  - Planning uncertainty: Lack predictive signals about at-risk features or sprints
  - People management: Need to spot burnout risk or overload before it becomes critical
  - Decision support: Want "what-if" planning to simulate reassignments or deadline shifts

  Goals They're Trying to Achieve:
  - Ensure balanced workload across team members
  - Deliver predictably on sprint commitments
  - Identify and remove blockers proactively
  - Communicate progress and risks clearly to stakeholders
  - Maintain team health and prevent burnout

  Why Taskly Appeals to Them:
  The Timeline view shows workload distribution and dependencies at a glance, auto-generated reports eliminate manual status
  compilation, and delivery confidence signals help them manage proactively instead of reactively. They get manager-level visibility
  without burdening developers with extra reporting.

  ---
  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Focused on two core segments (developers + managers) rather than spreading across 6+ personas
  - Positioned developers as primary (they're the daily users who drive adoption)
  - Managers as secondary (they champion tools but don't use them as frequently)
  - Omitted PM, QA, DevOps as separate segments for MVP focus, though their needs inform feature design

  Key assumptions:
  - Developer adoption drives tool selection more than top-down manager mandates
  - Teams of 5-50 developers are the sweet spot (not solo devs, not enterprises with 500+ devs)
  - GitHub/GitLab are universal enough to build on (not supporting SVN, Mercurial, etc.)

  Interesting decisions:
  - Called out specific pain points from role-playing session (e.g., "5-10 hours per week" double-entry)
  - Included psychological factors (trust, speed obsession) not just functional needs
  - Showed how each segment benefits differently from the same features (developers get speed, managers get visibility)

  Areas that might need validation:
  - Is 5-50 developers the right team size range? Should we go narrower (10-25) or broader?
  - Are there other critical segments (e.g., DevOps, QA) that should be primary for MVP?
  - Does the product manager role need to be elevated to primary segment?

  Goals & Success Metrics (Draft)

  Business Objectives

  - Achieve product-market fit within 6 months: Validate that Taskly solves the core problem by reaching 100+ active teams (500+
  developers) using the product weekly, with 40%+ retention after 30 days
  - Establish Git-native positioning as market differentiator: Become known as "the board that's actually connected to your code"
  through 50+ organic mentions, reviews, or case studies highlighting Git integration
  - Build sustainable growth engine by Q3 2026: Achieve 20% month-over-month user growth driven by word-of-mouth and developer
  community advocacy
  - Validate monetization model by end of year: Convert 15%+ of free users to paid tier, demonstrating willingness to pay for
  time-saving automation

  User Success Metrics

  - Time savings per developer: Reduce time spent on double-entry and manual board updates from 5-10 hours/week to <1 hour/week (80%+
  reduction)
  - Adoption rate within teams: When one developer adopts Taskly, 60%+ of their team adopts within 2 weeks (viral coefficient >0.6)
  - Daily active usage: 70%+ of users interact with Taskly daily (not weekly), indicating it's a core workflow tool
  - Code review context access: 90%+ of PRs linked to cards, ensuring reviewers have context available
  - Developer satisfaction: Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 50+ among daily users

  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

  - Weekly Active Teams (WAT): Number of teams with 3+ developers actively using Taskly weekly. Target: 100 teams by Month 6, 500
  teams by Month 12
  - Git Sync Success Rate: Percentage of card movements that successfully trigger Git operations without errors. Target: 95%+ success
  rate (measure reliability)
  - Time to First Value: Minutes from signup to first card linked to Git repo. Target: <10 minutes (measure onboarding friction)
  - View Switch Frequency: Average number of times users switch between Kanban/Timeline/Calendar per session. Target: 3+ switches
  (validates multi-view hypothesis)
  - Retention Cohorts: Percentage of teams still active after 7 days, 30 days, 90 days. Target: 60% Day 7, 40% Day 30, 25% Day 90
  - Support Ticket Volume: Tickets per 100 active users per week. Target: <5 (measure product quality and UX clarity)
  - Board-to-Git Sync Latency: Average time between card action and Git operation completion. Target: <3 seconds (measure performance)

  ---
  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Focused on leading indicators (adoption, usage patterns) over lagging indicators (revenue) for MVP phase
  - Set aggressive but achievable retention targets (40% at 30 days is strong for dev tools)
  - Emphasized viral growth within teams (60% adoption rate) since bottom-up adoption is core to strategy
  - Included technical KPIs (sync success rate, latency) alongside business metrics

  Key assumptions:
  - Time savings is quantifiable and users will recognize it (can validate through user research)
  - Word-of-mouth will drive growth if product genuinely delights developers
  - 15% paid conversion is achievable (industry benchmark for freemium dev tools is 10-20%)
  - NPS of 50+ is excellent for B2B SaaS (anything above 30 is good)

  Interesting decisions:
  - "View Switch Frequency" KPI validates whether multi-view design actually gets used vs. just being a nice-to-have feature
  - "Time to First Value" measures onboarding friction‚Äîcritical for developer tools where patience is low
  - "Code review context access" (90% of PRs linked) directly measures whether we're solving the root problem

  Areas needing validation:
  - Are the timeline targets (100 teams by Month 6) realistic given cold start?
  - Should we include quality metrics (bugs shipped, rework cycles) to measure impact on the core problem?
  - Is NPS the right satisfaction metric, or should we use something else (Customer Satisfaction Score, etc.)?

  MVP Scope (Draft)

  Core Features (Must Have)

  1. Kanban Board with Git Linking:
    - Drag-and-drop card management across customizable columns (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done)
    - Each card links to one or more GitHub/GitLab issues or PRs
    - Manual linking via URL or auto-detection when branch/PR references card ID
    - Card displays linked PR status, commits, and CI status inline
    - Rationale: Validates core hypothesis that context preservation (card‚Üîcode linking) solves the review context problem. Kanban
  first because it's the most familiar view.
  2. Comprehensive Card Metadata:
    - Title, description, acceptance criteria (markdown support)
    - Assignees (one or multiple), priority (Low/Medium/High/Urgent), labels/tags
    - Story points, sprint assignment, due dates
    - Comments and activity timeline
    - Rationale: Developers need rich metadata to make the board useful for actual project management, not just a pretty UI. This is
  table stakes.
  3. Basic Git Integration (GitHub OAuth):
    - Connect Taskly workspace to GitHub organization/repos via OAuth
    - When moving card to "In Progress," offer one-click branch creation with naming convention (e.g.,
  feature/TASK-123-brief-description)
    - When card is linked to PR, show PR status (draft/ready/approved/merged) and update card automatically when PR state changes
    - When PR is merged, optionally auto-move card to "Done"
    - Rationale: This is the minimum Git integration to eliminate double-entry. Start with GitHub (larger market share), add GitLab in
   Phase 2.
  4. Timeline View (Sprint Planning):
    - Horizontal timeline showing sprints/iterations
    - Cards grouped by sprint with story point totals
    - Drag cards between sprints to rebalance workload
    - Visual capacity indicators (overloaded vs. balanced)
    - Rationale: Multi-view differentiation starts here. Timeline view validates the "workload balancing" scenario from brainstorming.
   Critical for manager adoption.
  5. Keyboard-First Commands:
    - ‚åò+K command palette for quick actions (create card, search, assign, change status, navigate)
    - Keyboard navigation through cards and views
    - Common shortcuts (J/K for card navigation, C for create, E for edit)
    - Rationale: Developer adoption depends on speed. Keyboard shortcuts signal "we respect your time." Low effort, high impact.
  6. Team & Workspace Management:
    - Create workspace, invite team members via email
    - Basic role permissions (admin, member)
    - Multiple boards per workspace
    - Rationale: Can't validate team adoption without basic collaboration features. Keep permissions simple for MVP.
  7. Bulk Actions (Basic):
    - Multi-select cards (shift-click or checkbox)
    - Batch operations: assign multiple cards, add labels, change priority, move to column
    - Rationale: Directly addresses "tedious project management" pain point from brainstorming. Developers love batch operations.

  Out of Scope for MVP

  - Calendar View - Timeline view covers planning needs for MVP; calendar adds complexity without validating core hypothesis
  - Automated PR Creation with Templates - One-click branch creation is enough for MVP; auto-PR requires more complex GitHub App
  permissions
  - CI/CD Pipeline Integration - Showing PR status is enough; deep CI integration (test results, deployment status) is Phase 2
  - Auto-Generated Status Reports - Manual reporting reduction can wait until we have enough activity data to make summaries useful
  - Dependency Heatmaps & Blocking Detection - Complex feature requiring code analysis; defer until post-MVP
  - "What-If" Planning Mode - Advanced manager feature; Timeline view drag-and-drop is sufficient for MVP
  - GitLab Support - Start with GitHub only to reduce integration complexity; add GitLab in Phase 2 based on demand
  - DevOps Dashboard (Deployment Tracking) - Out of scope for developer + manager personas; focus on code review context first
  - Mobile App - Web-first; mobile can come later if desktop validation succeeds
  - Advanced Permissions (RBAC) - Simple admin/member roles are enough; granular permissions add complexity without MVP value
  - Integrations (Slack, Figma, etc.) - Focus on Git integration first; other integrations are nice-to-have

  MVP Success Criteria

  The MVP is successful if, after 8 weeks of development and 4 weeks of beta testing with 10 teams (50+ developers):

  1. Core Value Validated: 70%+ of beta users report that card-to-PR linking made code reviews easier/faster
  2. Time Savings Demonstrated: Users report spending 3+ fewer hours per week on board updates vs. their previous tool
  3. Git Integration Reliability: 90%+ success rate on branch creation and PR status syncing
  4. Multi-View Usage: 50%+ of users switch between Kanban and Timeline views at least once per session
  5. Adoption Within Teams: When one team member invites colleagues, 50%+ join and use the product within 1 week
  6. Developer Satisfaction: Beta users rate the product 8+/10 for "respects my time" and "easy to use daily"
  7. Technical Performance: <1 second page load, <3 seconds for Git operations, zero downtime during beta

  If these criteria are met, we proceed to broader launch. If not, we iterate based on feedback before expanding user base.

  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Included Timeline View in MVP despite complexity because it's core to multi-view differentiation and manager value prop
  - Excluded Calendar View to reduce scope while still validating multi-view hypothesis
  - Basic Git integration only (branch creation, PR linking) rather than full autopilot to de-risk technical complexity
  - GitHub first, not multi-platform to avoid spreading thin on integrations
  - No CI/CD integration in MVP even though it's part of vision - PR status is enough to validate linking value

  Key assumptions:
  - 8 weeks development + 4 weeks beta is realistic for this scope
  - Branch creation + PR linking is enough Git automation to demonstrate value (full autopilot can wait)
  - 10 beta teams (50 developers) is sufficient sample size to validate hypotheses
  - Timeline view is achievable in MVP timeline (might need to use existing library like react-calendar-timeline)

  Interesting decisions:
  - Defined very specific success criteria (percentages, timelines) to force clear go/no-go decision after MVP
  - Included "respects my time" as explicit satisfaction metric since it's core to developer adoption
  - Put bulk actions IN scope because it's relatively easy but high impact for user delight
  - Excluded many "manager features" to stay focused on developer adoption first

  Questions for you:
  - Is 8 weeks realistic for this scope with your team/resources?
  - Should Calendar View be in MVP, or is Timeline enough for initial validation?
  - Are there any out-of-scope items that should be IN scope, or vice versa?

  Post-MVP Vision (Draft)

  Phase 2 Features

  Once MVP validates product-market fit and achieves success criteria, Phase 2 (3-6 months post-MVP) focuses on deepening Git
  integration and expanding the "control surface" capabilities:

  1. Full Git Autopilot ("Move a Card, Ship the Code")
  - Moving card to "In Progress" auto-creates branch AND draft PR with template pre-filled
  - Moving to "In Review" assigns reviewers based on code ownership (CODEOWNERS file)
  - Moving to "QA" triggers preview environment deployment
  - Webhook-based bidirectional sync: commits update card progress, PR comments appear as card comments, CI failures trigger card
  notifications

  2. Calendar View
  - Deadline-focused view with milestones, release dates, and sprint boundaries
  - Visualize team availability (holidays, time off, scheduled meetings)
  - Drag cards to adjust due dates, see conflicts and dependencies

  3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration
  - Display test coverage, passing/failing tests inline on cards
  - Link deployment status (staging deployed, production live) to cards
  - Show build times, error logs, and performance metrics
  - Alert on failing builds or deployment issues directly in card

  4. Auto-Generated Status Reports & Summaries
  - Weekly sprint summaries auto-compiled from activity (commits, completions, blockers)
  - Stakeholder reports in plain language ready to share
  - Release notes auto-generated from completed cards

  5. GitLab Support
  - Full parity with GitHub integration (OAuth, branch creation, MR linking, webhooks)
  - Multi-platform teams can connect both GitHub and GitLab repos to one workspace

  6. Advanced Bulk Actions
  - Generate sub-tasks from PR diff analysis or test files
  - Batch link cards to existing PRs by pattern matching
  - Template-based card creation (create 10 cards from CSV or JSON)

  7. Dependency Tracking & Visualization
  - Manual dependency links between cards (blocks/blocked-by relationships)
  - Visual dependency graph showing critical path
  - Alert when blocked cards are assigned or scheduled

  Long-Term Vision (1-2 Years)

  The Ultimate Developer Workflow Hub:

  Taskly evolves from a project board into the central orchestration layer for the entire development lifecycle:

  - Code Intelligence: Automatically detect which cards touch which code modules; surface blockers based on code dependencies, not
  just manual links
  - Predictive Delivery Confidence: ML-powered insights showing which features are at risk based on historical velocity, test coverage
   trends, and team capacity
  - Cross-Repo Coordination: Manage dependencies across microservices; see how one service's delay affects downstream features
  - Outcome-Based Roadmaps: Link features to business KPIs/OKRs; automatically reprioritize based on measured impact
  - Developer Onboarding Assistant: AI-powered bot that answers new team member questions, suggests starter tasks, and provides
  codebase context
  - Team Health Dashboard: Burnout detection, context-switch analysis, workload balancing recommendations based on activity patterns
  - Integrations Ecosystem: Slack notifications, Figma design links, Sentry error tracking, analytics platforms‚Äîall contextually
  linked to cards

  Vision Statement:
  "Taskly becomes the single source of truth where work is planned, tracked, executed, and measured‚Äîeliminating fragmentation across 
  tools and ensuring every line of code is directly traceable to the business outcome it's meant to achieve."

  Expansion Opportunities

  1. Open-Source Core Model
  - Release core board functionality as open-source (community-driven adoption)
  - Monetize via cloud hosting, enterprise features (SSO, advanced permissions), or premium integrations

  2. Enterprise Tier
  - Advanced RBAC, audit logs, SAML/SSO
  - Dedicated support, SLA guarantees, on-premise deployment
  - Multi-workspace management for large organizations (100+ developers)

  3. Ecosystem Partnerships
  - Official integrations with DevOps platforms (CircleCI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
  - Partnerships with developer communities (dev.to, Hashnode, Indie Hackers) for distribution
  - IDE plugins (VS Code, JetBrains) for card creation and linking from within the editor

  4. Adjacent Markets
  - Non-Dev Teams: Adapt Git-native concept for design teams (Figma-native), marketing (campaign-native), sales (deal-native)
  - Education: University CS programs or bootcamps using Taskly to teach agile workflows alongside coding
  - Open-Source Projects: Free tier for public repos to support OSS maintainers and gain advocacy

  5. Data Product Opportunities
  - Anonymized benchmarking: "Your team's velocity is in the top 20% of similar-sized teams"
  - Industry reports: "State of Developer Productivity 2026" based on aggregate Taskly data
  - AI training data: Developer workflow patterns for future AI coding assistants

  ---
  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Phase 2 focuses on deepening Git integration (autopilot, CI/CD) rather than spreading to new platforms‚Äîvalidates differentiation
  before expanding
  - Long-term vision is ambitious ("central orchestration layer") but grounded in logical evolution from MVP
  - Expansion opportunities balance revenue (enterprise tier) with growth (open-source, free OSS tier)

  Key assumptions:
  - MVP success validates demand for Git-native approach, making deeper integration the right bet
  - Developer tools market rewards focus and excellence in one area over breadth
  - Open-source can drive adoption without cannibalizing paid tiers (freemium model works)
  - Team health / burnout detection will become increasingly important as remote work persists

  Interesting decisions:
  - Positioned "code intelligence" (auto-detect module dependencies) as long-term, not Phase 2‚Äîacknowledges technical complexity
  - Included "IDE plugins" as expansion opportunity‚Äîmeets developers where they already are
  - Suggested data product opportunities (benchmarking, reports)‚Äîleverage unique dataset as moat

  Areas needing validation:
  - Is open-source the right strategy, or does it risk commoditizing the core product?
  - Should Calendar View be in MVP instead of Phase 2?
  - Are we spreading too thin with expansion ideas, or is this appropriate blue-sky thinking?

       251 +     - Assignees (one or multiple), priority (Low/Medium/High/Urgent), labels/tags
       252 +     - Story points, sprint assignment, due dates
       253 +     - Comments and activity timeline
       254 +     - *Rationale:* Developers need rich metadata to make the board useful for actual project management, not just a 
           + pretty UI. This is table stakes.
       255 +  
       256 +  3. **Basic Git Integration (GitHub OAuth):**
       257 +     - Connect Taskly workspace to GitHub organization/repos via OAuth
       258 +     - When moving card to "In Progress," offer one-click branch creation with naming convention (e.g., 
           + `feature/TASK-123-brief-description`)
       259 +     - When card is linked to PR, show PR status (draft/ready/approved/merged) and update card automatically when PR 
           + state changes
       260 +     - When PR is merged, optionally auto-move card to "Done"
       261 +     - *Rationale:* This is the minimum Git integration to eliminate double-entry. Start with GitHub (larger market 
           + share), add GitLab in Phase 2.
       262 +  
       263 +  4. **Timeline View (Sprint Planning):**
       264 +     - Horizontal timeline showing sprints/iterations
       265 +     - Cards grouped by sprint with story point totals
       266 +     - Drag cards between sprints to rebalance workload
       267 +     - Visual capacity indicators (overloaded vs. balanced)
       268 +     - *Rationale:* Multi-view differentiation starts here. Timeline view validates the "workload balancing" scenario 
           + from brainstorming. Critical for manager adoption.
       269 +  
       270 +  5. **Keyboard-First Commands:**
       271 +     - ‚åò+K command palette for quick actions (create card, search, assign, change status, navigate)
       272 +     - Keyboard navigation through cards and views
       273 +     - Common shortcuts (J/K for card navigation, C for create, E for edit)
       274 +     - *Rationale:* Developer adoption depends on speed. Keyboard shortcuts signal "we respect your time." Low effort, 
           + high impact.
       275 +  
       276 +  6. **Team & Workspace Management:**
       277 +     - Create workspace, invite team members via email
       278 +     - Basic role permissions (admin, member)
       279 +     - Multiple boards per workspace
       280 +     - *Rationale:* Can't validate team adoption without basic collaboration features. Keep permissions simple for MVP.
       281 +  
       282 +  7. **Bulk Actions (Basic):**
       283 +     - Multi-select cards (shift-click or checkbox)
       284 +     - Batch operations: assign multiple cards, add labels, change priority, move to column
       285 +     - *Rationale:* Directly addresses "tedious project management" pain point from brainstorming. Developers love 
           + batch operations.
       286 +  
       287 +  ### Out of Scope for MVP
       288 +  
       289 +  - **Calendar View** - Timeline view covers planning needs for MVP; calendar adds complexity without validating core 
           + hypothesis
       290 +  - **Automated PR Creation with Templates** - One-click branch creation is enough for MVP; auto-PR requires more 
           + complex GitHub App permissions
       291 +  - **CI/CD Pipeline Integration** - Showing PR status is enough; deep CI integration (test results, deployment status)
           +  is Phase 2
       292 +  - **Auto-Generated Status Reports** - Manual reporting reduction can wait until we have enough activity data to make 
           + summaries useful
       293 +  - **Dependency Heatmaps & Blocking Detection** - Complex feature requiring code analysis; defer until post-MVP
       294 +  - **"What-If" Planning Mode** - Advanced manager feature; Timeline view drag-and-drop is sufficient for MVP
       295 +  - **GitLab Support** - Start with GitHub only to reduce integration complexity; add GitLab in Phase 2 based on demand
       296 +  - **DevOps Dashboard (Deployment Tracking)** - Out of scope for developer + manager personas; focus on code review 
           + context first
       297 +  - **Mobile App** - Web-first; mobile can come later if desktop validation succeeds
       298 +  - **Advanced Permissions (RBAC)** - Simple admin/member roles are enough; granular permissions add complexity without
           +  MVP value
       299 +  - **Integrations (Slack, Figma, etc.)** - Focus on Git integration first; other integrations are nice-to-have
       300 +  
       301 +  ### MVP Success Criteria
       302 +  
       303 +  The MVP is successful if, after 8 weeks of development and 4 weeks of beta testing with 10 teams (50+ developers):
       304 +  
       305 +  1. **Core Value Validated:** 70%+ of beta users report that card-to-PR linking made code reviews easier/faster
       306 +  2. **Time Savings Demonstrated:** Users report spending 3+ fewer hours per week on board updates vs. their previous 
           + tool
       307 +  3. **Git Integration Reliability:** 90%+ success rate on branch creation and PR status syncing
       308 +  4. **Multi-View Usage:** 50%+ of users switch between Kanban and Timeline views at least once per session
       309 +  5. **Adoption Within Teams:** When one team member invites colleagues, 50%+ join and use the product within 1 week
       310 +  6. **Developer Satisfaction:** Beta users rate the product 8+/10 for "respects my time" and "easy to use daily"
       311 +  7. **Technical Performance:** <1 second page load, <3 seconds for Git operations, zero downtime during beta
       312 +  
       313 +  If these criteria are met, we proceed to broader launch. If not, we iterate based on feedback before expanding user 
           + base.

  Post-MVP Vision (Draft)

  Phase 2 Features

  Once MVP validates product-market fit and achieves success criteria, Phase 2 (3-6 months post-MVP) focuses on deepening Git
  integration and expanding the "control surface" capabilities:

  1. Full Git Autopilot ("Move a Card, Ship the Code")
  - Moving card to "In Progress" auto-creates branch AND draft PR with template pre-filled
  - Moving to "In Review" assigns reviewers based on code ownership (CODEOWNERS file)
  - Moving to "QA" triggers preview environment deployment
  - Webhook-based bidirectional sync: commits update card progress, PR comments appear as card comments, CI failures trigger card
  notifications

  2. Calendar View
  - Deadline-focused view with milestones, release dates, and sprint boundaries
  - Visualize team availability (holidays, time off, scheduled meetings)
  - Drag cards to adjust due dates, see conflicts and dependencies

  3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration
  - Display test coverage, passing/failing tests inline on cards
  - Link deployment status (staging deployed, production live) to cards
  - Show build times, error logs, and performance metrics
  - Alert on failing builds or deployment issues directly in card

  4. Auto-Generated Status Reports & Summaries
  - Weekly sprint summaries auto-compiled from activity (commits, completions, blockers)
  - Stakeholder reports in plain language ready to share
  - Release notes auto-generated from completed cards

  5. GitLab Support
  - Full parity with GitHub integration (OAuth, branch creation, MR linking, webhooks)
  - Multi-platform teams can connect both GitHub and GitLab repos to one workspace

  6. Advanced Bulk Actions
  - Generate sub-tasks from PR diff analysis or test files
  - Batch link cards to existing PRs by pattern matching
  - Template-based card creation (create 10 cards from CSV or JSON)

  7. Dependency Tracking & Visualization
  - Manual dependency links between cards (blocks/blocked-by relationships)
  - Visual dependency graph showing critical path
  - Alert when blocked cards are assigned or scheduled

  Long-Term Vision (1-2 Years)

  The Ultimate Developer Workflow Hub:

  Taskly evolves from a project board into the central orchestration layer for the entire development lifecycle:

  - Code Intelligence: Automatically detect which cards touch which code modules; surface blockers based on code dependencies, not
  just manual links
  - Predictive Delivery Confidence: ML-powered insights showing which features are at risk based on historical velocity, test coverage
   trends, and team capacity
  - Cross-Repo Coordination: Manage dependencies across microservices; see how one service's delay affects downstream features
  - Outcome-Based Roadmaps: Link features to business KPIs/OKRs; automatically reprioritize based on measured impact
  - Developer Onboarding Assistant: AI-powered bot that answers new team member questions, suggests starter tasks, and provides
  codebase context
  - Team Health Dashboard: Burnout detection, context-switch analysis, workload balancing recommendations based on activity patterns
  - Integrations Ecosystem: Slack notifications, Figma design links, Sentry error tracking, analytics platforms‚Äîall contextually
  linked to cards

  Vision Statement:
  "Taskly becomes the single source of truth where work is planned, tracked, executed, and measured‚Äîeliminating fragmentation across 
  tools and ensuring every line of code is directly traceable to the business outcome it's meant to achieve."

  Expansion Opportunities

  1. Open-Source Core Model
  - Release core board functionality as open-source (community-driven adoption)
  - Monetize via cloud hosting, enterprise features (SSO, advanced permissions), or premium integrations

  2. Enterprise Tier
  - Advanced RBAC, audit logs, SAML/SSO
  - Dedicated support, SLA guarantees, on-premise deployment
  - Multi-workspace management for large organizations (100+ developers)

  3. Ecosystem Partnerships
  - Official integrations with DevOps platforms (CircleCI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
  - Partnerships with developer communities (dev.to, Hashnode, Indie Hackers) for distribution
  - IDE plugins (VS Code, JetBrains) for card creation and linking from within the editor

  4. Adjacent Markets
  - Non-Dev Teams: Adapt Git-native concept for design teams (Figma-native), marketing (campaign-native), sales (deal-native)
  - Education: University CS programs or bootcamps using Taskly to teach agile workflows alongside coding
  - Open-Source Projects: Free tier for public repos to support OSS maintainers and gain advocacy

  5. Data Product Opportunities
  - Anonymized benchmarking: "Your team's velocity is in the top 20% of similar-sized teams"
  - Industry reports: "State of Developer Productivity 2026" based on aggregate Taskly data
  - AI training data: Developer workflow patterns for future AI coding assistants

  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Phase 2 focuses on deepening Git integration (autopilot, CI/CD) rather than spreading to new platforms‚Äîvalidates differentiation
  before expanding
  - Long-term vision is ambitious ("central orchestration layer") but grounded in logical evolution from MVP
  - Expansion opportunities balance revenue (enterprise tier) with growth (open-source, free OSS tier)

  Key assumptions:
  - MVP success validates demand for Git-native approach, making deeper integration the right bet
  - Developer tools market rewards focus and excellence in one area over breadth
  - Open-source can drive adoption without cannibalizing paid tiers (freemium model works)
  - Team health / burnout detection will become increasingly important as remote work persists

  Interesting decisions:
  - Positioned "code intelligence" (auto-detect module dependencies) as long-term, not Phase 2‚Äîacknowledges technical complexity
  - Included "IDE plugins" as expansion opportunity‚Äîmeets developers where they already are
  - Suggested data product opportunities (benchmarking, reports)‚Äîleverage unique dataset as moat

  Areas needing validation:
  - Is open-source the right strategy, or does it risk commoditizing the core product?
  - Should Calendar View be in MVP instead of Phase 2?
  - Are we spreading too thin with expansion ideas, or is this appropriate blue-sky thinking?

  Technical Considerations (Draft)

  Platform Requirements

  - Target Platforms: Web application (desktop-first), responsive design for tablet support
  - Browser/OS Support:
    - Modern browsers: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
    - Desktop OS: macOS, Windows, Linux
    - No IE11 support (modern web APIs required for real-time features)
  - Performance Requirements:
    - Page load: <1 second for initial load (cached), <2 seconds cold start
    - View transitions: <500ms when switching between Kanban/Timeline views
    - Git operations: <3 seconds for branch creation, PR linking
    - Real-time updates: <1 second latency for webhook-triggered card updates
    - Concurrent users: Support 100+ simultaneous users per workspace without degradation

  Technology Preferences

  Frontend: Next.js 14+ (React)
  - Why Next.js: Server-side rendering for fast initial loads, excellent developer experience, built-in routing, API routes for BFF
  pattern
  - UI Framework: Tailwind CSS for rapid styling, Radix UI or shadcn/ui for accessible components
  - State Management: Zustand or Jotai (lightweight, modern) for client state; React Query for server state and caching
  - Drag-and-Drop: @dnd-kit (modern, accessible, performant) for Kanban board
  - Timeline View: react-calendar-timeline or custom implementation with D3.js
  - Real-time: WebSocket client (Socket.IO or native WebSockets) for live updates
  - Deployment: Vercel (seamless Next.js hosting) or self-hosted Docker containers

  Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
  - Why FastAPI: High performance, async support for webhooks, excellent OpenAPI docs, type safety with Pydantic
  - API Design: RESTful endpoints + WebSocket for real-time; consider GraphQL if query complexity grows
  - Authentication: OAuth 2.0 for GitHub integration, JWT tokens for session management
  - Background Jobs: Celery + Redis for async tasks (Git operations, webhook processing)
  - GitHub Integration: PyGithub or direct REST API calls via httpx
  - Testing: pytest, pytest-asyncio, factory_boy for fixtures
  - Deployment: Docker containers orchestrated via Docker Compose (dev) or Kubernetes (production scale)

  Database: PostgreSQL 15+
  - Why PostgreSQL: JSONB for flexible metadata, excellent full-text search, mature replication, strong consistency
  - ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async support) with Alembic for migrations
  - Schema Design:
    - Core tables: workspaces, boards, cards, users, teams
    - Git entities: repositories, branches, pull_requests, commits (cached from GitHub)
    - Relationships: many-to-many for cards‚ÜîPRs, users‚Üîworkspaces
  - Indexing Strategy: B-tree indexes on foreign keys, GIN indexes on JSONB metadata for fast filtering
  - Caching: Redis for session data, frequently accessed boards, rate limiting

  Hosting/Infrastructure: Docker + Cloud Platform
  - Containerization: Docker Compose for local dev, multi-container setup (Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery worker)
  - Cloud Platform (Production): AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean
    - App containers: ECS (AWS) or Cloud Run (GCP)
    - Database: RDS PostgreSQL (AWS) or managed PostgreSQL (DigitalOcean)
    - Caching: ElastiCache Redis (AWS) or managed Redis
    - Load balancing: ALB (AWS) or Cloud Load Balancer
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building Docker images, deploying to staging/production
  - Monitoring: Sentry for error tracking, Datadog or Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, structured logging (JSON logs)

  Architecture Considerations

  Repository Structure
  - Monorepo approach: Single repository with separate directories for frontend (/frontend) and backend (/backend)
    - Pros: Easier coordination during rapid development, atomic commits spanning FE+BE, simpler CI/CD
    - Cons: Larger repo size, requires tooling to manage (Nx or Turborepo)
    - Alternative: Separate repos if teams grow and need independent deployment cadence

  Service Architecture
  - Monolithic API for MVP: Single FastAPI application handling all endpoints
    - Simpler to develop and debug
    - Defer microservices until scale demands it (100k+ users)
  - Job Queue Pattern: Separate Celery worker processes for long-running tasks:
    - Git operations (branch creation, webhook processing)
    - Bulk actions (batch card updates, report generation)
    - Email notifications
  - WebSocket Service: Dedicated WebSocket server (can be part of FastAPI or separate) for real-time board updates

  Integration Requirements
  - GitHub OAuth & API:
    - OAuth App registration for user authentication
    - GitHub App installation for deeper permissions (webhook subscriptions, write access to repos)
    - Webhook endpoints to receive PR updates, commit events, CI status changes
    - Rate limiting handling (5000 req/hour for authenticated users)
  - Webhook Reliability:
    - Idempotent webhook handlers (handle duplicate deliveries)
    - Retry logic with exponential backoff
    - Dead letter queue for failed webhook processing
  - Third-Party Services:
    - Email: SendGrid or AWS SES for transactional emails (invites, notifications)
    - File storage: S3 or equivalent for attachments (if cards support file uploads post-MVP)

  Security/Compliance
  - Authentication & Authorization:
    - GitHub OAuth for signup/login (no password management)
    - JWT tokens with short expiration (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
    - RBAC: workspace-level permissions (admin, member)
  - Data Protection:
    - HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.3)
    - Encryption at rest for PostgreSQL (AWS RDS encryption)
    - Secrets management: Environment variables via Docker secrets or AWS Secrets Manager
    - API rate limiting: per-user and per-IP to prevent abuse
  - Compliance:
    - GDPR compliance: user data export, right to deletion
    - SOC 2 considerations for future enterprise tier (audit logs, access controls)
    - GitHub token storage: encrypted in database, never logged
  - Vulnerability Management:
    - Dependabot for dependency updates
    - Regular security audits (npm audit, pip-audit, Snyk)
    - Penetration testing before production launch

  ---
  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Monorepo for MVP despite potential cons‚Äîprioritizes development speed and simplicity over long-term scalability
  - Next.js on Vercel offers best DX but vendor lock-in; mitigated by Docker fallback option
  - Monolithic API instead of microservices‚Äîpremature optimization is root of all evil; split when necessary
  - PostgreSQL over NoSQL for strong consistency and relational data model (cards have many relationships)

  Key assumptions:
  - Team is comfortable with Python/FastAPI and React/Next.js stack
  - Docker proficiency exists or can be learned quickly
  - GitHub is the primary Git platform (90%+ of target users)
  - Initial scale is <10k users; architecture can evolve as needed

  Interesting decisions:
  - Celery + Redis for background jobs ensures Git operations don't block API requests
  - WebSocket for real-time instead of polling‚Äîbetter UX and lower server load
  - JSONB for card metadata provides flexibility without schema migrations for every new field
  - GitHub App + OAuth hybrid gives both user auth and repo permissions

  Areas needing validation:
  - Is monorepo the right choice, or will separate repos reduce friction?
  - Should we use GraphQL instead of REST to reduce over-fetching for complex boards?
  - Is FastAPI + Python the right backend choice vs. Node.js (TypeScript across stack)?
  - Do we need Kubernetes from day one, or is Docker Compose + managed services enough?

       418 +    - **Concurrent users:** Support 100+ simultaneous users per workspace without degradation
       419 +  
       420 +  ### Technology Preferences
       421 +  
       422 +  **Frontend: Next.js 14+ (React)**
       423 +  - **Why Next.js:** Server-side rendering for fast initial loads, excellent developer experience, built-in routing, 
           + API routes for BFF pattern
       424 +  - **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS for rapid styling, Radix UI or shadcn/ui for accessible components
       425 +  - **State Management:** Zustand or Jotai (lightweight, modern) for client state; React Query for server state and 
           + caching
       426 +  - **Drag-and-Drop:** @dnd-kit (modern, accessible, performant) for Kanban board

       430 +  
       431 +  **Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)**
       432 +  - **Why FastAPI:** High performance, async support for webhooks, excellent OpenAPI docs, type safety with Pydantic
       433 +  - **API Design:** RESTful endpoints + WebSocket for real-time; consider GraphQL if query complexity grows
       434 +  - **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 for GitHub integration, JWT tokens for session management
       435 +  - **Background Jobs:** Celery + Redis for async tasks (Git operations, webhook processing)
       436 +  - **GitHub Integration:** PyGithub or direct REST API calls via httpx
       437 +  - **Testing:** pytest, pytest-asyncio, factory_boy for fixtures
       438 +  - **Deployment:** Docker containers orchestrated via Docker Compose (dev) or Kubernetes (production scale)
       439 +  
       440 +  **Database: PostgreSQL 15+**
       441 +  - **Why PostgreSQL:** JSONB for flexible metadata, excellent full-text search, mature replication, strong consistency
       442 +  - **ORM:** SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async support) with Alembic for migrations
       443 +  - **Schema Design:**
       444 +    - Core tables: workspaces, boards, cards, users, teams
       445 +    - Git entities: repositories, branches, pull_requests, commits (cached from GitHub)
       446 +    - Relationships: many-to-many for cards‚ÜîPRs, users‚Üîworkspaces
       447 +  - **Indexing Strategy:** B-tree indexes on foreign keys, GIN indexes on JSONB metadata for fast filtering
       448 +  - **Caching:** Redis for session data, frequently accessed boards, rate limiting
       449 +  
       450 +  **Hosting/Infrastructure: Docker + Cloud Platform**
       451 +  - **Containerization:** Docker Compose for local dev, multi-container setup (Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, 
           + Celery worker)
       452 +  - **Cloud Platform (Production):** AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean
       453 +    - App containers: ECS (AWS) or Cloud Run (GCP)
       454 +    - Database: RDS PostgreSQL (AWS) or managed PostgreSQL (DigitalOcean)
       455 +    - Caching: ElastiCache Redis (AWS) or managed Redis
       456 +    - Load balancing: ALB (AWS) or Cloud Load Balancer
       457 +  - **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing, building Docker images, deploying to staging/production
       458 +  - **Monitoring:** Sentry for error tracking, Datadog or Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, structured logging (JSON 
           + logs)
       459 +  
       460 +  ### Architecture Considerations
       461 +  
       462 +  **Repository Structure**
       463 +  - **Monorepo approach:** Single repository with separate directories for frontend (`/frontend`) and backend 
           + (`/backend`)
       464 +    - **Pros:** Easier coordination during rapid development, atomic commits spanning FE+BE, simpler CI/CD
       465 +    - **Cons:** Larger repo size, requires tooling to manage (Nx or Turborepo)
       466 +    - **Alternative:** Separate repos if teams grow and need independent deployment cadence
       467 +  
       468 +  **Service Architecture**
       469 +  - **Monolithic API for MVP:** Single FastAPI application handling all endpoints
       470 +    - Simpler to develop and debug
       471 +    - Defer microservices until scale demands it (100k+ users)
       472 +  - **Job Queue Pattern:** Separate Celery worker processes for long-running tasks:
       473 +    - Git operations (branch creation, webhook processing)
       474 +    - Bulk actions (batch card updates, report generation)
       475 +    - Email notifications
       476 +  - **WebSocket Service:** Dedicated WebSocket server (can be part of FastAPI or separate) for real-time board updates
       477 +  
       478 +  **Integration Requirements**
       479 +  - **GitHub OAuth & API:**
       480 +    - OAuth App registration for user authentication
       481 +    - GitHub App installation for deeper permissions (webhook subscriptions, write access to repos)
       482 +    - Webhook endpoints to receive PR updates, commit events, CI status changes
       483 +    - Rate limiting handling (5000 req/hour for authenticated users)
       484 +  - **Webhook Reliability:**
       485 +    - Idempotent webhook handlers (handle duplicate deliveries)
       486 +    - Retry logic with exponential backoff
       487 +    - Dead letter queue for failed webhook processing
       488 +  - **Third-Party Services:**
       489 +    - Email: SendGrid or AWS SES for transactional emails (invites, notifications)
       490 +    - File storage: S3 or equivalent for attachments (if cards support file uploads post-MVP)
       491 +  
       492 +  **Security/Compliance**
       493 +  - **Authentication & Authorization:**
       494 +    - GitHub OAuth for signup/login (no password management)
       495 +    - JWT tokens with short expiration (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
       496 +    - RBAC: workspace-level permissions (admin, member)
       497 +  - **Data Protection:**
       498 +    - HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.3)
       499 +    - Encryption at rest for PostgreSQL (AWS RDS encryption)
       500 +    - Secrets management: Environment variables via Docker secrets or AWS Secrets Manager
       501 +    - API rate limiting: per-user and per-IP to prevent abuse
       502 +  - **Compliance:**
       503 +    - GDPR compliance: user data export, right to deletion
       504 +    - SOC 2 considerations for future enterprise tier (audit logs, access controls)
       505 +    - GitHub token storage: encrypted in database, never logged
       506 +  - **Vulnerability Management:**
       507 +    - Dependabot for dependency updates
       508 +    - Regular security audits (npm audit, pip-audit, Snyk)
       509 +    - Penetration testing before production launch
       510 +

  Constraints & Assumptions (Draft)

  Constraints

  Budget:
  - MVP Development: Bootstrap/self-funded or seed round ($50k-150k runway)
  - Infrastructure Costs: Targeting <$500/month for MVP (cloud hosting, third-party services)
  - Team Size: 1-3 developers (solo founder or small co-founding team)
  - Marketing Budget: Minimal paid acquisition; relying on organic growth and developer communities
  - Constraint Impact: Must prioritize ruthlessly; GitHub-only integration, no enterprise features, web-only (no mobile)

  Timeline:
  - MVP Delivery: 8-10 weeks from project kickoff to beta-ready product
  - Beta Testing: 4 weeks with 10 teams before broader launch
  - Go-to-Market: Week 13-16 (public launch, Product Hunt, community outreach)
  - Product-Market Fit Validation: 6 months from launch to hit 100 active teams
  - Constraint Impact: Must use proven technologies; limited time for R&D or custom solutions; monorepo and monolithic architecture to
   move fast

  Resources:
  - Development Team: 1-2 full-stack engineers (or solo founder wearing all hats)
  - Design Resources: Minimal custom design; leverage component libraries (shadcn/ui) and templates
  - QA/Testing: No dedicated QA; developer-led testing + beta user feedback
  - DevOps: Managed cloud services (Vercel, AWS RDS) to avoid infrastructure management overhead
  - Constraint Impact: No dedicated specialists; full-stack generalists required; automation and simplicity are critical

  Technical:
  - GitHub API Rate Limits: 5000 requests/hour per authenticated user; must implement aggressive caching and webhook-based updates
  instead of polling
  - Real-Time Sync Challenges: WebSocket connections have cost and complexity; must balance real-time UX with infrastructure
  simplicity
  - Data Migration Complexity: Users switching from Trello/Jira won't have automated migration in MVP; must provide CSV import or
  manual setup
  - Browser Compatibility: Modern web APIs only (no IE11, older Safari); may exclude ~5-10% of potential users
  - Constraint Impact: Architecture designed around rate limits; webhook-first strategy; simplified onboarding without migration tools

  Key Assumptions

  - Market demand exists: Software teams are actively frustrated with existing tools and willing to try alternatives (validated
  through dev community discussions, not formal research yet)
  - GitHub dominance: 80%+ of target users use GitHub (not GitLab, Bitbucket); focusing on GitHub first won't exclude the majority
  - Bottom-up adoption works: Individual developers will adopt first and champion to their teams; no need for top-down enterprise
  sales in MVP phase
  - Git-native is differentiated enough: The board‚Üîcode linking value proposition is compelling enough to overcome switching costs
  from Trello/Jira/Linear
  - Developer time savings are measurable: Users will recognize 3-5 hours/week saved from eliminating double-entry; this justifies
  eventual paid conversion
  - Freemium model is viable: 15-20% of users will convert to paid tier for advanced features (based on industry benchmarks for dev
  tools)
  - Technical feasibility is sound: GitHub API + webhooks + FastAPI async can reliably deliver <3 second Git operations at MVP scale
  (<10k users)
  - Team composition: Founding team has full-stack experience with React, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker; no need for extensive learning
  curves
  - Competitive response time: 6-12 months before Linear/Jira/Shortcut build comparable Git-native features; first-mover advantage
  window exists
  - Open-source option is deferred: MVP is closed-source SaaS; open-source can be evaluated post-PMF if community demand emerges
  - Regulatory compliance is manageable: GDPR basics (data export, deletion) are implementable without legal team; SOC 2 deferred to
  enterprise phase
  - User research is lightweight: Beta users provide qualitative feedback; formal user research (interviews, surveys) happens
  iteratively, not upfront

  ---
  Rationale:

  Trade-offs made:
  - Acknowledged budget constraints honestly (bootstrap/seed) rather than assuming unlimited resources
  - Set aggressive but realistic timeline (8 weeks MVP) to force scope discipline
  - Called out technical constraints explicitly (GitHub rate limits, browser compat) to avoid surprises later
  - Included assumptions about competition (6-12 month window) to highlight urgency

  Key assumptions:
  - Solo or small team scenario (1-3 devs) shapes every decision‚Äîno time for complex processes or exotic tech
  - Market demand is assumed based on anecdotal evidence, not validated‚Äîthis is a risk
  - Git hub dominance assumption is critical; if wrong, GitLab support becomes urgent
  - Freemium conversion rate (15-20%) is industry benchmark but unproven for this specific product

  Interesting decisions:
  - Included "team composition" assumption to clarify skill requirements‚Äînot every founder team can execute this
  - Called out "competitive response time" as assumption‚Äîacknowledges risk of fast-followers
  - Made open-source a deferred decision rather than commitment‚Äîkeeps options open

  Areas needing validation:
  - Is 8 weeks realistic for the defined MVP scope with 1-2 developers?
  - Are infrastructure costs truly <$500/month at MVP scale, or optimistic?
  - Is the 6-12 month competitive window accurate, or will incumbents move faster?

       574 +  ## Risks & Open Questions
       575 +  
       576 +  ### Key Risks
       577 +  
       578 +  - **GitHub API Dependency:** Complete reliance on GitHub's API stability and rate limits. **Impact:** Service 
           + disruptions if GitHub has outages or changes API terms. **Mitigation:** Aggressive caching, webhook-based updates, 
           + graceful degradation when API is unavailable.
       579 +  
       580 +  - **Competitive Response Speed:** Linear, Jira, or Shortcut could build comparable Git integration faster than 
           + expected. **Impact:** Loss of differentiation before achieving product-market fit. **Mitigation:** Move fast on MVP, 
           + establish brand as "Git-native leader," build community advocacy.
       581 +  
       582 +  - **User Switching Costs:** Developers already invested in Trello/Jira may resist switching despite pain points. 
           + **Impact:** Lower adoption rates than projected. **Mitigation:** Provide seamless onboarding, CSV import from existing
           +  tools, demo videos showing time savings.
       583 +  
       584 +  - **Technical Complexity Underestimation:** Bidirectional Git sync, webhooks, and real-time updates may be more 
           + complex than anticipated. **Impact:** MVP timeline slips beyond 8-10 weeks. **Mitigation:** Start with simplest Git 
           + integration (manual linking), add automation incrementally; buffer 2-3 weeks in timeline.
       585 +  
       586 +  - **Market Size Uncertainty:** 5-50 developer teams using GitHub may be smaller addressable market than assumed. 
           + **Impact:** Slower growth, difficulty reaching 100 teams in 6 months. **Mitigation:** Validate market size through 
           + user research; consider expanding to larger teams or GitLab support earlier if needed.
       587 +  
       588 +  - **Monetization Timing:** Introducing paid tiers too early or too late could impact growth or sustainability. 
           + **Impact:** Revenue shortfall or user churn. **Mitigation:** Launch with generous free tier, introduce paid features 
           + based on usage data and user feedback at 3-6 month mark.
       589 +  
       590 +  - **Developer Adoption vs. Manager Buy-In:** Bottom-up adoption may fail if managers mandate existing tools (Jira) 
           + despite developer preference. **Impact:** Individual users can't champion Taskly to full team. **Mitigation:** Provide
           +  manager-focused value (Timeline view, auto-reports) early to address both personas.
       591 +  
       592 +  ### Open Questions
       593 +  
       594 +  - **Pricing Strategy:** What features should be free vs. paid? Freemium, per-user pricing, or team-based tiers? When 
           + to introduce paid plans?
       595 +  
       596 +  - **GitHub vs. GitLab Priority:** Is GitHub-first the right strategy, or should MVP support both from day one? What 
           + percentage of target market uses GitLab?
       597 +  
       598 +  - **Onboarding Flow:** What's the optimal path from signup to first value (linked card ‚Üí PR)? Should we require 
           + GitHub connection immediately or allow exploration first?
       599 +  
       600 +  - **Team Collaboration Features:** Does MVP need real-time presence indicators (who's viewing/editing)? Comments, 
           + @mentions, notifications?
       601 +  
       602 +  - **Mobile Strategy:** Is web-responsive enough, or will users demand native mobile apps for on-the-go updates?
       603 +  
       604 +  - **Data Retention & Performance:** How long do we store Git event history (commits, PR updates)? Balance between 
           + rich history and database size/cost.
       605 +  
       606 +  - **Board Templates:** Should MVP include pre-built board templates (Scrum, Kanban, Bug Triage), or let users create 
           + from scratch?
       607 +  
       608 +  - **Permissions Granularity:** Are simple admin/member roles sufficient, or do users need card-level permissions (who
           +  can edit/delete specific cards)?
       609 +  
       610 +  - **Internationalization:** Is English-only acceptable for MVP, or should we support multiple languages from the 
           + start?
       611 +  
       612 +  - **Offline Support:** Should the web app work offline (with sync when reconnected), or require constant internet 
           + connection?
       613 +  
       614 +  ### Areas Needing Further Research
       615 +  
       616 +  - **User Acquisition Channels:** Which developer communities (Reddit, Hacker News, dev.to, Twitter/X) will be most 
           + effective for organic growth? What content strategy drives sign-ups?
       617 +  
       618 +  - **Competitive Intelligence:** Deep dive into Linear, Height, Shortcut roadmaps‚Äîwhat are they building? Are they 
           + aware of Git-native opportunity?
       619 +  
       620 +  - **Technical Feasibility Validation:** Prototype GitHub webhook handling and branch creation to validate <3 second 
           + performance assumption before full MVP build.
       621 +  
       622 +  - **Developer Pain Point Quantification:** Conduct 10-20 interviews with target users to validate time waste 
           + estimates (5-10 hours/week) and prioritize feature importance.
       623 +  
       624 +  - **Pricing Research:** Survey potential users on willingness to pay, acceptable price points, and which features 
           + justify paid tiers.
       625 +  
       626 +  - **Scalability Testing:** Load test Docker Compose setup to understand real limits‚Äî100 users? 1000? 10k? When do we 
           + hit constraints?
       627 +  
       628 +  - **Legal/Compliance Requirements:** Consult with legal advisor on GDPR, data privacy, terms of service, and GitHub 
           + API compliance.
