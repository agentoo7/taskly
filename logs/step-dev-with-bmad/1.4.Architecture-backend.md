  I'll process each section sequentially, presenting content with detailed rationale and eliciting your feedback where marked. Let's
  begin!

  Section 1: Introduction

  1.1 Introduction Content

  This document outlines the overall project architecture for Taskly, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific
  concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and
  adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

  Relationship to Frontend Architecture:
  If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific
  design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are
  definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

  1.2 Starter Template or Existing Project

  Rationale & Analysis:

  Based on my review of the PRD, I found the following technology decisions:

  Frontend: Next.js 14+ with App RouterBackend: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)Repository Structure: Monorepo

  The PRD specifies a monorepo structure with /frontend and /backend directories but does NOT explicitly mention using starter
  templates. However, given the technology choices, I recommend considering:

  For Backend (FastAPI):
  - Option 1: Start from scratch with FastAPI's minimal setup (simple main.py)
  - Option 2: Use fastapi-template or full-stack-fastapi-template for pre-configured structure
  - Recommendation: Start from scratch - FastAPI is intentionally minimal, and the PRD specifies custom architecture (async
  SQLAlchemy, Celery, WebSockets). A starter would add unnecessary boilerplate.

  For Frontend (Next.js):
  - Option 1: create-next-app with TypeScript + Tailwind template (standard approach)
  - Option 2: shadcn/ui Next.js template (includes shadcn/ui pre-configured)
  - Recommendation: Use create-next-app with TypeScript + Tailwind, then add shadcn/ui components manually. This gives us the official
   Next.js structure while maintaining control.

  For Monorepo:
  - The PRD mentions "Turborepo or Nx for monorepo management or keep simple with npm workspaces for MVP"
  - Recommendation: Start with npm workspaces (simple, no external deps) and migrate to Turborepo if needed for build caching.

  Decision Draft:
  - Backend: No starter template (manual FastAPI setup following PRD architecture)
  - Frontend: create-next-app --typescript --tailwind for initial scaffolding
  - Monorepo: npm workspaces for simplicity

  ‚ö†Ô∏è ELICITATION REQUIRED - Select 1-9 or type your question/feedback:

  1. Proceed to next section (accept the starter template recommendations above)
  2. Five Whys - Explore deeper reasoning behind the "no backend starter" recommendation
  3. Pre-Mortem Analysis - Identify what could go wrong with npm workspaces vs Turborepo choice
  4. Trade-off Analysis - Compare starter templates vs manual setup systematically
  5. Assumption Testing - Challenge assumptions about keeping things simple for MVP
  6. Alternative Scenarios - Explore what happens if we use a full-stack starter instead
  7. Constraint Relaxation - What if we removed the "keep it simple" constraint from PRD?
  8. Second-Order Effects - How does this choice impact Epic 1 Story 1.1 implementation?
  9. Stakeholder Perspective - View this decision from the developer's onboarding experience

  Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:

> For Backend: option1 

‚è∫ Perfect! Backend: Option 1 confirmed - Start from scratch with FastAPI's minimal setup.

  Let me clarify the complete decision before proceeding:

  Starter Template Decision:
  - ‚úÖ Backend (FastAPI): No starter template - manual setup with main.py
  - Frontend (Next.js): create-next-app --typescript --tailwind
  - Monorepo: npm workspaces

  Questions before I proceed:

  1. Do you also confirm Frontend: create-next-app and Monorepo: npm workspaces?
  2. Or would you like different choices for frontend/monorepo?

  Type your preference or just "proceed" if you approve all three recommendations above.

> do backend first 

‚è∫ Understood! Backend architecture focus confirmed.

  I notice you've opened /Users/binhthaitran/Documents/temp/test-bmad/taskly/4.Architecture-backend.md.

  Quick clarification:
  - Should I output to 4.Architecture-backend.md instead of docs/architecture.md?
  - Or keep the original path from the template?

  Please confirm the output file path, then I'll proceed with:
  - ‚úÖ Backend-focused architecture (FastAPI, no starter template)
  - ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip or minimize frontend-specific sections
  - üìù Section 1.3: Change Log next

  Type the file path you want or just "continue" to use docs/architecture.md

> continue 

‚è∫ Perfect! Continuing with docs/architecture.md for backend architecture.

  1.2 Starter Template Decision - Final

  Backend (FastAPI): No starter template - manual setup from scratch
  - Rationale: FastAPI is minimal by design; PRD specifies custom architecture (async SQLAlchemy 2.0, Celery, FastAPI WebSockets).
  Manual setup gives full control without unnecessary boilerplate.

  Frontend: Deferred to separate Frontend Architecture Document (out of scope for backend architecture)

  Monorepo: npm workspaces (simple, built-in, sufficient for MVP)

  Section 2: High Level Architecture

  Now I'll present the complete high-level architecture overview with all subsections together. This establishes the architectural
  foundation before we dive into tech stack decisions.

  Processing subsections:
  - Technical Summary
  - High Level Overview
  - High Level Project Diagram
  - Architectural and Design Patterns

  Let me draft this comprehensive section...

‚è∫ ---
  HIGH LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

  Technical Summary

  Taskly employs a monolithic API architecture with a separate background job queue, deployed as a containerized application using
  Docker. The backend is built on FastAPI (Python 3.11+) with async SQLAlchemy 2.0 for database operations and Celery + Redis for
  asynchronous task processing. The system integrates tightly with GitHub via OAuth 2.0 and webhooks, enabling bidirectional
  synchronization between project boards and Git repositories. Real-time collaboration is powered by FastAPI WebSockets with Redis
  pub/sub for multi-instance coordination. This architecture directly supports the PRD's core goal: treating the project board as a
  "control surface for your repo" by automating Git workflows (branch creation, PR linking) and reflecting code activity (commits, CI
  status, merges) on cards in real-time, eliminating double-entry work and preserving task-to-code context.

  High Level Overview

  1. Architectural Style: Monolithic API with Job Queue Separation

  Per PRD Technical Assumptions, we're using a single FastAPI application handling all REST endpoints and WebSocket connections, with
  Celery workers processing long-running tasks asynchronously. This avoids premature microservices complexity while maintaining
  non-blocking API responses for Git operations.

  2. Repository Structure: Monorepo (npm workspaces)

  Single repository with /frontend and /backend directories enables atomic commits, simplified CI/CD, and reduced context switching
  for the small team (1-3 developers).

  3. Service Architecture Components:
  - FastAPI API Server: REST endpoints, WebSocket server, synchronous request handling
  - Celery Workers: Git operations (branch creation, webhook processing), bulk updates, email notifications
  - PostgreSQL 15+: Primary data store (relational data + JSONB for flexible metadata)
  - Redis: Celery message broker, session storage, caching layer, WebSocket pub/sub

  4. Primary User/Data Flow:
  - User authenticates via GitHub OAuth ‚Üí JWT tokens issued
  - User manipulates cards on board (drag-and-drop, edit) ‚Üí FastAPI API updates PostgreSQL ‚Üí WebSocket broadcasts changes
  - User clicks "Create Branch" ‚Üí FastAPI enqueues Celery job ‚Üí Celery worker calls GitHub API ‚Üí Card updated with branch link
  - GitHub webhook fires (PR merged) ‚Üí FastAPI validates, enqueues job ‚Üí Celery processes ‚Üí Card auto-moved to Done ‚Üí WebSocket
  notifies users

  5. Key Architectural Decisions:

  | Decision                    | Rationale
                        |
  |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ----------------------|
  | Monolith over Microservices | PRD targets <10k users; monolith simpler to develop/debug/deploy. Scale vertically first.
                        |
  | Celery for async jobs       | GitHub API calls can take 1-3s; offloading to workers keeps API responsive (<200ms).
                        |
  | PostgreSQL (not NoSQL)      | JSONB provides flexibility, but relational model fits boards/cards/users better. ACID transactions
  critical for Git sync. |
  | FastAPI WebSockets          | Integrated solution; no need for separate Socket.IO server. Falls back to polling if needed.
                        |
  | Redis for multiple concerns | Consolidated infrastructure: message broker + cache + pub/sub reduces operational complexity.
                        |

  Architectural and Design Patterns

  Pattern Selection Rationale: These patterns align with PRD goals (Git-native sync, real-time collaboration, developer productivity)
  and the chosen tech stack.

  1. Repository Pattern
  - Description: Abstract data access logic behind repository interfaces (CardRepository, WorkspaceRepository, etc.)
  - Implementation: SQLAlchemy 2.0 async sessions wrapped in repository classes
  - Rationale: Enables unit testing with mock repositories, isolates ORM concerns from business logic, makes future database
  migrations easier.
  - Example: CardRepository.get_by_id(card_id) instead of direct session.query(Card).filter_by(id=card_id)

  2. Service Layer Pattern
  - Description: Business logic lives in service classes (CardService, GitIntegrationService), not in API route handlers
  - Implementation: Services injected into FastAPI dependencies
  - Rationale: Keeps route handlers thin (validation + serialization only), reusable logic across API and Celery tasks, easier
  testing.
  - Example: CardService.move_card(card_id, target_column_id) handles position recalculation, activity logging, WebSocket broadcast

  3. Background Job Pattern (Task Queue)
  - Description: Long-running operations executed asynchronously via Celery
  - Implementation: Celery tasks with retry logic, idempotency keys, progress tracking
  - Rationale: PRD requires <3s Git operations; Celery offloads work, maintains API responsiveness. Retry with exponential backoff
  handles GitHub API flakiness.
  - Jobs: create_branch_task, process_webhook_task, bulk_update_cards_task, send_email_task

  4. Webhook Event Handler Pattern
  - Description: Idempotent webhook processors with signature validation and event routing
  - Implementation: FastAPI endpoint validates HMAC, enqueues job with event_id deduplication
  - Rationale: GitHub may deliver webhooks multiple times; idempotency prevents duplicate card updates. Async processing prevents
  webhook timeout retries.
  - Flow: POST /webhooks/github ‚Üí validate signature ‚Üí check event_id in Redis ‚Üí enqueue if new ‚Üí return 200 OK

  5. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS-lite)
  - Description: Separate read models (queries) from write operations (commands)
  - Implementation: Read queries hit cached data (Redis), writes invalidate cache and broadcast via WebSocket
  - Rationale: Board views are read-heavy (users browsing cards); caching reduces database load. Writes trigger invalidation +
  real-time sync.
  - Example: GET /boards/{id} serves cached board, PATCH /cards/{id} updates DB + clears cache + broadcasts

  6. Optimistic UI Pattern (Frontend-Backend Contract)
  - Description: Frontend applies changes immediately, backend confirms/rolls back
  - Implementation: API returns updated entity + timestamp; WebSocket broadcasts canonical state
  - Rationale: PRD requires <500ms UI responsiveness; optimistic updates eliminate perceived lag. Backend is source of truth.

  7. Circuit Breaker Pattern (GitHub API Resilience)
  - Description: Temporarily stop calling GitHub API after repeated failures
  - Implementation: tenacity library with exponential backoff, max retries, circuit breaker state
  - Rationale: GitHub API rate limits (5000 req/hr) or outages shouldn't crash Taskly. Graceful degradation: show stale data with
  warning.
