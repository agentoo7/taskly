  Taskly UI/UX Specification

  I'll guide you through each section of the specification, presenting drafts based on your PRD and then offering you opportunities to
   refine, expand, or adjust the content. This ensures the final document perfectly matches your vision.

  Section 1: Introduction

  Let me start by drafting the introduction section based on your PRD:

  Introduction

  This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Taskly's
   user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered
  experience.

  The specification is informed by the Product Requirements Document and focuses on delivering a "developer-first, zero-friction" UX
  philosophy that prioritizes speed, clarity, and keyboard-driven workflows. Taskly bridges project management and code development,
  transforming traditional boards into a Git-native "control surface for your repo."

  Rationale:
  - I've positioned this as the bridge between the PRD and implementation
  - Emphasized the unique "developer-first" positioning from your PRD
  - Highlighted the Git-native differentiation

  Now let me draft the Overall UX Goals & Principles subsection, which requires your input:

  Overall UX Goals & Principles

  Based on your PRD, I've identified the following:

  Target User Personas

  1. Developer (Primary): Software engineers (IC levels) who need fast task-to-code workflows. They value keyboard shortcuts, GitHub
  integration, and minimal context switching. Success = moving from card to PR in <30 seconds.
  2. Engineering Manager (Secondary): Tech leads and engineering managers who need sprint planning and team capacity visibility. They
  value Timeline view, workload balancing, and progress tracking. Success = planning 2-week sprint in <15 minutes.
  3. Product/Project Manager (Tertiary): PMs who collaborate with dev teams and need to track feature status linked to code. They
  value card metadata, filtering, and real-time PR status. Success = understanding "what shipped" without asking developers.

  Usability Goals

  - Ease of learning: New developers can create their first card and link it to a PR within 5 minutes of onboarding
  - Efficiency of use: Power users can navigate entire board, create cards, and move between views using only keyboard (zero mouse
  dependency)
  - Git operation speed: Branch creation from card completes in <3 seconds; PR status updates appear in <1 second via webhooks
  - Minimal cognitive load: Card status (In Progress, PR status, CI results) visible at a glance without opening details
  - Error prevention: Destructive actions (delete card, disconnect repo, delete workspace) require explicit confirmation with typed
  verification for critical operations

  Design Principles

  1. Speed Above All - Every interaction must complete in <500ms with optimistic UI updates. Perceived performance matters more than
  technical benchmarks.
  2. Keyboard-First, Mouse-Optional - Power users should accomplish 95% of tasks via keyboard. Command palette (⌘+K) is the primary
  interface for experienced users.
  3. Context Preservation - Never force users to leave Taskly to understand task state. PR status, commits, CI results visible inline
  on cards.
  4. Progressive Disclosure - Cards show summary by default (title, assignee, PR badge); expand inline for full context. Balance
  information density with visual calm.
  5. GitHub-Native Integration - Git operations (branch creation, PR linking, webhooks) should feel like native Taskly features, not
  "integrations."

  ---
  Detailed Rationale:

  Trade-offs Made:
  - Chose 3 personas over broader targeting to maintain focus on developer workflows
  - Prioritized Developer persona explicitly as they're the daily users; managers use Timeline view less frequently
  - Set aggressive usability goals (<5 min onboarding, <3s Git ops) to reinforce "zero-friction" positioning

  Key Assumptions:
  - Users are GitHub-experienced developers (not teaching Git concepts)
  - Desktop-first usage (developers work on laptops with keyboards)
  - Teams of 5-50 developers (from PRD target market)

  Interesting Decisions:
  - "Speed Above All" as #1 principle matches PRD's developer-tool aesthetic over consumer app feel
  - "Context Preservation" directly addresses PRD's core problem: reviewer context loss
  - Fifth principle elevates Git from "feature" to "philosophy" - this is a Git-native tool, not a project manager with Git bolted on

  Areas Needing Validation:
  - Are 3 personas sufficient, or should we add "DevOps/Release Manager" who uses boards to track deployments?
  - Is 5-minute onboarding goal realistic given GitHub OAuth + workspace creation + board setup?
  - Should "Accessibility from the Start" be a top-5 principle given WCAG AA target in PRD?

  Section 2: Information Architecture (IA)

  Based on your PRD's core screens specification, I'll create a comprehensive information architecture showing all major screens and
  navigation structure:

  Site Map / Screen Inventory

      S --> S4[Step 4: Create First Card]

      D --> T[Planning Mode]
      T --> U[Sprint Stats Panel]
      T --> V[Bulk Actions Bar]

  Navigation Structure

  Primary Navigation (Top Bar - Always Visible):
  - Left: Taskly logo (returns to Workspace Dashboard)
  - Center: Current workspace name (dropdown to switch workspaces)
  - Right: Command palette trigger (⌘+K badge visible), User avatar (dropdown: Profile, Settings, Logout)

  Secondary Navigation (Board Context):
  - Board header bar:
    - Left: Board name (inline editable), Star/favorite toggle
    - Center: View toggle buttons (Kanban | Timeline), Active sprint indicator (for Timeline view)
    - Right: Filter controls (Assignee, Label, Priority dropdowns), Search input, Board settings gear icon

  Breadcrumb Strategy:
  - Workspace Dashboard: No breadcrumb (top level)
  - Board Views: Workspace Name > Board Name (both clickable)
  - Card Detail Modal: Overlays current view, shows card ID + title in modal header, no breadcrumb change
  - Settings Pages: Workspace Name > Settings or Board Name > Board Settings
  - Breadcrumbs remain persistent in top bar even when modals open (provides context anchoring)

  Contextual Navigation (Modal/Overlay):
  - Command Palette (⌘+K): Global overlay accessible from anywhere, keyboard-driven navigation
  - Card Detail: Modal overlay with tabs (Details | Activity | Linked PRs), close via Escape or X button
  - Onboarding Wizard: Full-screen takeover with step indicators (1/4, 2/4, etc.), Skip option in top-right

  Mobile/Tablet Adaptation:
  - Tablet (768-1024px): Primary nav collapses workspace dropdown to icon, secondary nav shows only View toggle + Search (other
  controls in overflow menu)
  - Mobile (<768px): Simplified nav with hamburger menu, no command palette (touch-optimized alternatives)

  ---
  Detailed Rationale:

  Trade-offs Made:
  - Persistent breadcrumbs over modal-based breadcrumbs: Keeps users oriented even in deep modal interactions (e.g., Card Detail with
  Create Branch dialog open). Alternative was to hide breadcrumbs in modals, but that breaks spatial awareness.
  - Command palette as "navigation layer": Treated ⌘+K as equal to visual navigation rather than "power user addon." Reflects
  keyboard-first philosophy but may confuse mouse-only users initially.
  - No sidebar navigation: Chose top bar + context bar over left sidebar to maximize horizontal space for Kanban columns and Timeline.
   This is a deliberate departure from typical SaaS apps (e.g., Notion, Linear have sidebars) but matches developer tool UX (GitHub,
  VS Code top nav).

  Key Assumptions:
  - Users primarily navigate within a single workspace/board during a session (minimal cross-workspace context switching)
  - Most navigation happens via search/command palette rather than hierarchical clicking
  - Developers prefer horizontal layout (multi-column Kanban) over vertical (sidebar + content)

  Interesting Decisions:
  - Onboarding as separate flow: Wizard takes over full screen rather than inline tour. Ensures users complete critical setup (connect
   GitHub, create board) before accessing app.
  - Sprint indicator in secondary nav: Shows "Sprint 2 (Day 5 of 14)" even in Kanban view to maintain sprint context awareness. This
  bridges Timeline view planning with Kanban daily execution.
  - Card Detail as modal, not side panel: Many modern tools (Linear, Height) use side panels. I chose modal to force focus on single
  card + activity, preventing split attention during code reviews.

  Areas Needing Validation:
  - Should command palette badge be always visible, or appear only on hover/keyboard shortcut? (Discoverability vs. visual clutter)
  - Is workspace switcher needed in top nav, or should users go back to dashboard to switch? (Convenience vs. simplicity)
  - Should Board Settings be in board header or command palette only? (Accessibility vs. clean header)

⏺ Perfect! Now let's move to the User Flows section - this is critical for visualizing how users accomplish their key tasks.

  ---
  Section 3: User Flows

  Based on your PRD, I've identified 4 critical user flows that define the Taskly experience. Let me draft each one:

  Flow 1: Complete Task Workflow (Card to Merged PR)

  User Goal: Move a development task from idea to deployed code with automated synchronization

  Entry Points:
  - Kanban board "To Do" column
  - Command palette: ⌘+K → "Create Card"
  - Quick-create button in any column header

  Success Criteria:
  - Card automatically moves to "Done" when PR merges
  - All Git activity visible on card without leaving Taskly
  - Zero manual status updates required

  Flow Diagram

  graph TD
      A[User creates card in To Do] --> B[User fills title, description, acceptance criteria]
      B --> C[User drags card to In Progress]
      C --> D{Branch already exists?}

      D -->|No| E[User clicks Create Branch button]
      E --> F[System generates branch name: feature/CARD-123-title]
      F --> G[User confirms/edits branch name]
      G --> H[Backend creates branch via GitHub API]
      H --> I[Success: Branch link displayed on card]

      D -->|Yes| J[User links existing PR via URL]

      I --> K[User codes in local environment]
      J --> K

      K --> L[User commits & pushes to branch]
      L --> M[User creates PR on GitHub]
      M --> N[Webhook: PR opened detected]
      N --> O[Card auto-linked via branch name pattern]
      O --> P[PR status displayed on card: Draft/Open]

      P --> Q[CI runs, webhook updates card]
      Q --> R{CI Passed?}
      R -->|No| S[Card shows red X, failed checks]
      S --> T[Developer fixes, pushes again]
      T --> Q

      R -->|Yes| U[Card shows green checkmark]
      U --> V[Reviewer approves PR]
      V --> W[PR merged on GitHub]
      W --> X[Webhook: PR merged detected]
      X --> Y[Backend auto-moves card to Done]
      Y --> Z[Card animates to Done column in real-time]

  Edge Cases & Error Handling:

  - Branch name conflict: Show error "Branch already exists", suggest alternative name with -v2 suffix, offer link to existing branch
  - GitHub API timeout: Show loading state for max 5s, then error toast "Couldn't create branch. Retry or create manually." with
  copy-branch-name button
  - PR auto-link fails: User can manually link PR via "+ Link Pull Request" button, system learns pattern for future auto-detection
  - Multiple linked PRs: Card only auto-moves when ALL linked PRs are merged (configurable: "any" vs "all" in board settings)
  - User removed from workspace: Webhook-triggered auto-move uses system actor "[GitHub]" to bypass permission checks

  Notes: This is the "golden path" that validates Taskly's core value proposition. Every optimization here (branch creation speed,
  webhook latency, real-time updates) directly impacts user satisfaction. Target: complete this flow 10x/day per developer without
  friction.

  ---
  Flow 2: Sprint Planning Session (Manager Persona)

  User Goal: Plan upcoming 2-week sprint by assigning cards from backlog and balancing team capacity

  Entry Points:
  - Board header → Switch to Timeline view
  - Command palette: ⌘+K → "Switch to Timeline View"

  Success Criteria:
  - Sprint reaches 80-100% capacity without overload
  - All team members have balanced workload
  - Cards assigned with clear prioritization

  Flow Diagram

  graph TD
      A[Manager clicks Timeline view toggle] --> B[System loads Timeline with sprints + backlog]
      B --> C[Manager enables Planning Mode toggle]
      C --> D[UI switches to wide backlog + sprint columns]

      D --> E[Manager reviews Sprint 3 capacity: 15/40 pts]
      E --> F[Manager clicks card in backlog]
      F --> G{Single or multi-select?}

      G -->|Single| H[Drag card to Sprint 3 column]
      G -->|Multi-select| I[Shift+click multiple cards]
      I --> J[Click Assign to Sprint button]
      J --> K[Select Sprint 3 from dropdown]

      H --> L[Capacity bar updates: 20/40 pts]
      K --> L

      L --> M{Capacity OK?}
      M -->|<100%| N[Continue adding cards]
      M -->|>100%| O[Warning badge: Sprint Overloaded]
      O --> P[Manager removes cards or adjusts capacity]

      N --> Q[Manager checks assignee distribution]
      Q --> R{Any team member >100%?}
      R -->|Yes| S[Red dot on assignee avatar]
      S --> T[Manager reassigns cards to balance]
      R -->|No| U[Sprint health: Balanced]

      T --> U
      U --> V[Manager reviews next sprint]
      V --> W[Repeat for Sprint 4, 5...]
      W --> X[Exit Planning Mode]
      X --> Y[Return to normal Timeline view]

  Edge Cases & Error Handling:

  - Empty backlog: Show empty state "All caught up! No unplanned cards." with "Create Card" button
  - No sprints defined: Timeline shows only backlog column + tooltip "Create your first sprint in Board Settings"
  - Over-capacity drag attempt: Show confirmation modal "Sprint 3 is overloaded (45/40 pts). Add 3 cards anyway?" with Yes/Cancel
  - Bulk assign to full sprint: System adds all cards but displays warning "Sprint 3 now overloaded (+15 pts over capacity)"
  - Undo accidental bulk move: Ctrl+Z immediately reverts sprint assignment for last action (session-based undo stack)

  Notes: Timeline view differentiates Taskly from Trello/Linear. Capacity indicators (color-coded bars, health scores) must be
  instantly scannable. Target: plan full sprint in <15 minutes vs. 30-45 minutes in spreadsheet/manual board updates.

  ---
  Flow 3: Onboarding New User (First-Time Experience)

  User Goal: Go from signup to first linked PR in <10 minutes

  Entry Points:
  - Marketing site "Get Started" CTA
  - Direct signup URL

  Success Criteria:
  - User completes: GitHub auth → workspace created → repository connected → board created → first card linked to PR
  - User understands Taskly's core value (Git synchronization)
  - Zero drop-off during critical steps

  Flow Diagram

  GitHub" button
  - Workspace name taken: Inline validation: "Workspace name already exists, try another"
  - User exits wizard early: Show "Resume setup" banner on next login, allow skip to partial state (e.g., workspace created but no
  board)
  - Slow GitHub API: Show skeleton loaders for repo list, timeout after 10s with "Having trouble loading repos. Continue anyway?"
  option

  Notes: First impression critical. Each step must feel instant (<500ms transitions). Celebrate small wins (confetti on board
  creation, success checkmark on PR link). Skip button available after Step 2 for experienced users who want to explore first.

  Flow 4: Command Palette Power User Workflow

  User Goal: Accomplish common tasks without touching mouse using keyboard shortcuts

  Entry Points:
  - Any screen: Press ⌘+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux)

  Success Criteria:
  - User navigates to any screen, creates cards, switches views, and performs bulk actions entirely via keyboard
  - Command palette responds in <100ms

      V --> W[Card detail modal opens]

      W --> X[User makes changes, presses Escape]
      X --> Y[Modal closes, back to Timeline view]

  Edge Cases & Error Handling:

  - No fuzzy match found: Show "No commands found. Try different keywords or press ? for help"
  - Command disabled in current context: Show grayed-out command with tooltip "Not available in Timeline view"
  - Recent commands empty: Section hidden until user executes first command
  - Keyboard shortcut conflict: Settings page shows warning "Shortcut ⌘+B already assigned to Bold. Reassign?" when user tries to
  customize
  - Slow search (>100ms): Debounce at 150ms, show spinner only if search takes >300ms

  Notes: Command palette is Taskly's "superpower" for developers. Must feel as fast as Spotlight/Alfred. Recent commands list (5 most
  recent) accelerates repeated actions. Card search mode (#) eliminates need for visual scanning on large boards.

  ---
  Detailed Rationale:

  Trade-offs Made:
  - 4 flows vs. comprehensive coverage: Chose most critical paths that span all personas (Developer Flow 1, Manager Flow 2, First-time
   user Flow 3, Power user Flow 4). Skipped secondary flows like "Invite team member" or "Configure board settings" as they're less
  frequent.
  - Mermaid diagrams vs. written steps: Visual flow diagrams are easier for designers to translate to prototypes, but verbose for
  developers. Included both (diagram + edge cases prose) to serve both audiences.
  - Edge case detail level: Heavily documented error states because PRD emphasizes "zero-friction" - every error is a friction point.
  Alternative was to keep flows "happy path only" but that hides real UX complexity.

  Key Assumptions:
  - Users follow flows sequentially (Flow 3 onboarding → Flow 1 daily work → eventually Flow 4 power user shortcuts)
  - Managers use Timeline view 1-2x/sprint, developers use Kanban daily
  - Webhook reliability is high (>99%) so "PR status not updating" edge case is rare

  Interesting Decisions:
  - Auto-link PR from branch name: Reduces manual linking friction. Assumes developer uses Taskly-created branches or follows naming
  convention.
  - Planning Mode as separate toggle: Keeps Timeline view clean for quick reference, activates "bulk editing mindset" when planning.
  Could have been always-on but would clutter UI.
  - Onboarding as wizard vs. interactive tour: Wizard forces completion of critical setup before app access. Alternative (in-app
  tooltips) risks users skipping GitHub connection and hitting walls later.
  - Command palette "chaining": Multi-step commands (Create Card → Select Column) keep palette open. Feels more conversational than
  discrete commands requiring ⌘+K between each step.

  Areas Needing Validation:
  - Flow 1: Should "Create Branch" be automatic when card moves to "In Progress" vs. manual button click? (Auto = faster, Manual =
  more control)
  - Flow 2: Is Planning Mode necessary or could bulk operations work in regular Timeline view? (Dedicated mode = clear intent,
  Integrated = fewer modes to learn)
  - Flow 3: Should onboarding allow "skip" at Step 1 (workspace creation)? (More flexible but risks orphaned accounts)
  - Flow 4: Should command palette support natural language ("create card in progress for authentication bug") vs. structured
  commands? (NL = more intuitive, Structured = more predictable)

       117 +  ## User Flows
       118 +  
       119 +  ### Flow 1: Complete Task Workflow (Card to Merged PR)
       120 +  
       121 +  **User Goal:** Move a development task from idea to deployed code with automated synchronization
       122 +  
       123 +  **Entry Points:**
       124 +  - Kanban board "To Do" column
       125 +  - Command palette: ⌘+K → "Create Card"
       126 +  - Quick-create button in any column header
       127 +  
       128 +  **Success Criteria:**
       129 +  - Card automatically moves to "Done" when PR merges
       130 +  - All Git activity visible on card without leaving Taskly
       131 +  - Zero manual status updates required
       132 +

       169 +      Y --> Z[Card animates to Done column in real-time]
       170 +  ```
       171 +  
       172 +  #### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
       173 +  
       174 +  - **Branch name conflict:** Show error "Branch already exists", suggest alternative name with -v2 suffix, offer link 
           + to existing branch
       175 +  - **GitHub API timeout:** Show loading state for max 5s, then error toast "Couldn't create branch. Retry or create 
           + manually." with copy-branch-name button
       176 +  - **PR auto-link fails:** User can manually link PR via "+ Link Pull Request" button, system learns pattern for 
           + future auto-detection
       177 +  - **Multiple linked PRs:** Card only auto-moves when ALL linked PRs are merged (configurable: "any" vs "all" in board
           +  settings)
       178 +  - **User removed from workspace:** Webhook-triggered auto-move uses system actor "[GitHub]" to bypass permission 
           + checks
       179 +  
       180 +  **Notes:** This is the "golden path" that validates Taskly's core value proposition. Every optimization here (branch 
           + creation speed, webhook latency, real-time updates) directly impacts user satisfaction. Target: complete this flow 
           + 10x/day per developer without friction.
       181 +  
       182 +  ### Flow 2: Sprint Planning Session (Manager Persona)
       183 +  
       184 +  **User Goal:** Plan upcoming 2-week sprint by assigning cards from backlog and balancing team capacity
       185 +  
       186 +  **Entry Points:**
       187 +  - Board header → Switch to Timeline view
       188 +  - Command palette: ⌘+K → "Switch to Timeline View"
       189 +  
       190 +  **Success Criteria:**
       191 +  - Sprint reaches 80-100% capacity without overload
       192 +  - All team members have balanced workload
       193 +  - Cards assigned with clear prioritization

       231 +  ```
       232 +  
       233 +  #### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
       234 +  
       235 +  - **Empty backlog:** Show empty state "All caught up! No unplanned cards." with "Create Card" button
       236 +  - **No sprints defined:** Timeline shows only backlog column + tooltip "Create your first sprint in Board Settings"
       237 +  - **Over-capacity drag attempt:** Show confirmation modal "Sprint 3 is overloaded (45/40 pts). Add 3 cards anyway?" 
           + with Yes/Cancel
       238 +  - **Bulk assign to full sprint:** System adds all cards but displays warning "Sprint 3 now overloaded (+15 pts over 
           + capacity)"
       239 +  - **Undo accidental bulk move:** Ctrl+Z immediately reverts sprint assignment for last action (session-based undo 
           + stack)
       240 +  
       241 +  **Notes:** Timeline view differentiates Taskly from Trello/Linear. Capacity indicators (color-coded bars, health 
           + scores) must be instantly scannable. Target: plan full sprint in <15 minutes vs. 30-45 minutes in spreadsheet/manual 
           + board updates.
       242 +  
       243 +  ### Flow 3: Onboarding New User (First-Time Experience)
       244 +  
       245 +  **User Goal:** Go from signup to first linked PR in <10 minutes
       246 +  
       247 +  **Entry Points:**
       248 +  - Marketing site "Get Started" CTA
       249 +  - Direct signup URL
       250 +  
       251 +  **Success Criteria:**
       252 +  - User completes: GitHub auth → workspace created → repository connected → board created → first card linked to PR
       253 +  - User understands Taskly's core value (Git synchronization)
       254 +  - Zero drop-off during critical steps

       363 +  
       364 +  **Notes:** Command palette is Taskly's "superpower" for developers. Must feel as fast as Spotlight/Alfred. Recent 
           + commands list (5 most recent) accelerates repeated actions. Card search mode (#) eliminates need for visual scanning 
           + on large boards.

⏺ Excellent! Now let's move to the Wireframes & Mockups section, where we'll outline the key screen layouts.

  ---
  Section 4: Wireframes & Mockups

  Since detailed visual designs are typically created in design tools like Figma or Sketch, I'll provide conceptual descriptions of
  key screen layouts that your design team can use as a foundation. These descriptions focus on layout structure, key UI elements, and
   interaction patterns.

  Primary Design Files

  Design Tool: Recommended - Figma (for collaborative design and developer handoff with inspect mode)

  Design File Organization:
  - Page 1: Design System (colors, typography, components)
  - Page 2: Core Screens (Kanban, Timeline, Card Detail, Dashboard)
  - Page 3: Modals & Overlays (Command Palette, Onboarding Wizard, Settings)
  - Page 4: Mobile/Tablet Responsive Variants
  - Page 5: Interactive Prototype (linked frames for user testing)

  Key Screen Layouts

  Screen 1: Kanban Board View

  Purpose: Primary daily workspace for developers to manage task flow and visualize work in progress

  Key Elements:

  Layout Structure:
  - Fixed Top Bar (60px height): Primary navigation + breadcrumbs
  - Fixed Board Header (80px height): Board name, view toggle, filters, search, settings
  - Scrollable Content Area: Multi-column Kanban board with horizontal scroll if needed
  - Floating Elements: Command palette overlay (⌘+K), Card detail modal, notification toasts

  Column Layout:
  - Each column: 320px width, 16px gap between columns
  - Column header: Title (editable inline), card count badge, "+ Add Card" button, column menu (⋯)
  - Cards stack vertically with 12px gap
  - Empty columns show dashed border + "Drag cards here" placeholder

  Card Compact View (Collapsed State):
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ CARD-123                      [...]  │  ← Card ID + Quick actions menu
  │ Implement user authentication        │  ← Title (truncated at 2 lines)
  │                                      │
  │ 👤👤  🏷️Bug  ⚡High  PR#45 ✓        │  ← Assignees, Labels, Priority, PR badge, CI status
  │ Due: Oct 25                          │  ← Due date (red if overdue)
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

  Interaction Notes:
  - Hover: Card lifts with shadow, quick action icons appear (edit, assign, delete)
  - Click: Expands card inline to show description preview (3 lines) with "View Full Details" link, OR opens card detail modal
  (configurable in settings)
  - Drag: Card follows cursor with semi-transparent ghost, drop zones highlight with blue border
  - Multi-select: Checkbox appears in top-left corner on hover, blue border when selected

  Real-Time Indicators:
  - Other users viewing same board: Small avatar dots at bottom-right of screen "3 others viewing"
  - Someone editing card: Pulsing yellow border on that card with tooltip "Alice is editing"
  - Webhook update: Card briefly flashes green when status changes (e.g., PR merged → auto-moves to Done)

  - Active sprint badge: Green "Active" label, cannot be deleted (must complete first)
  - Complete sprint: Opens confirmation "Mark Sprint 3 as completed?" → archives sprint, moves unfinished cards to backlog
  - Delete sprint: Requires confirmation + typing sprint name for destructive action

  Screen 8: Mobile/Tablet Responsive (Tablet Landscape 1024x768)

  Purpose: Touch-optimized Kanban board for tablet devices

  Key Elements:

  Tablet Layout Adaptations:
  - Board header: Condensed to 60px, workspace switcher becomes icon only, filters in overflow menu
  - Columns: 280px width (vs 320px desktop), 12px gaps
  - Cards: Slightly larger touch targets (48px minimum height for tap zones)
  - Drag-and-drop: Long-press (500ms hold) activates drag mode, visual feedback shows "Dragging..." label
  - Command palette: Not accessible (no keyboard), replaced with search icon → full-screen search view

  Mobile Portrait (<768px):
  - Single-column view: Shows one column at a time, horizontal swipe to change columns
  - Column selector: Horizontal scrolling tab bar at top (To Do | In Progress | In Review | Done)
  - Cards: Full-width minus 16px padding
  - Message banner: "Editing best experienced on desktop. Viewing available on mobile."
  - Create card disabled: Shows tooltip "Use desktop to create cards"

  Design File Reference: Figma Frame: Responsive-Tablet-Mobile

  Detailed Rationale:

  Trade-offs Made:
  - Modal vs. Side Panel for Card Detail: Chose modal (full-screen focus) over side panel (multi-tasking). Rationale: Code review
  requires deep focus; side panel invites split attention. Inspired by GitHub PR review flow (full-screen diff view).
  - Card Compact vs. Card Expanded Default: Compact by default (title + metadata only), expand on click. Alternative: Always show
  description preview. Rationale: Compact view fits more cards on screen (important for >50 card boards), description often not needed
   during quick scans.
  - Timeline Planning Mode Toggle: Separate mode vs. always-on bulk tools. Rationale: Planning mode signals "different mindset"
  (strategic planning vs. tactical execution). Also declutters Timeline for quick reference use.

  Key Assumptions:
  - Users have 1920x1080+ desktop monitors (320px columns × 4 columns + gaps = ~1400px width minimum)
  - Dark mode preference split 50/50, so both themes equally polished (not dark as afterthought)
  - Figma as design tool (prototyping, dev handoff with code snippets, design system management)

  Interesting Decisions:
  - Real-time collaboration indicators: Subtle presence dots (not obtrusive names), yellow pulse on actively edited cards. Inspired by
   Figma multiplayer cursors but less distracting for task boards.
  - Capacity bars as primary metric: Positioned in sprint headers (always visible) vs. buried in settings. Reflects manager persona
  need for instant capacity assessment.
  - Command palette visual design: Intentionally minimal (search box + text list) vs. rich graphics. Rationale: Speed perception—less
  visual processing required, faster execution.
  - Onboarding as blocking wizard: Full-screen takeover vs. optional tour tooltips. Rationale: GitHub connection is critical; skipping
   breaks app. Better to force 2 minutes of setup than debug "Why aren't my PRs syncing?" later.

  Areas Needing Validation:
  - Card width: Is 320px optimal, or should columns be narrower (280px) to fit more on screen?
  - Timeline sprint columns: Fixed 280px width vs. dynamic width based on card count?
  - Mobile strategy: Read-only mobile experience vs. invest in full mobile editing? (MVP scope decision)
  - Command palette discoverability: Always show "⌘+K" badge in top bar, or only show on first visit with tooltip?

⏺ Perfect! Let me save the Wireframes section and continue to Component Library & Design System.

⏺ Update(docs/front-end-spec.md)
  ⎿  Updated docs/front-end-spec.md with 142 additions                                                                             
       363    
       364    **Notes:** Command palette is Taskly's "superpower" for developers. Must feel as fast as Spotlight/Alfred. Recent 
             commands list (5 most recent) accelerates repeated actions. Card search mode (#) eliminates need for visual scanning 
             on large boards.

⏺ Excellent! Now let's move to Component Library & Design System - this is where we define the foundational building blocks for
  Taskly's interface.

  ---
  Section 5: Component Library / Design System

  Based on your PRD's emphasis on developer tools aesthetics and the shadcn/ui + Tailwind stack, let me draft the component library
  approach:

  Design System Approach

  Strategy: Customize shadcn/ui component library (built on Radix UI primitives) rather than build from scratch

  Rationale:
  - shadcn/ui provides accessible, composable React components that copy directly into your codebase (not npm dependency)
  - Built on Radix UI primitives ensuring WCAG AA compliance by default (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, focus management)
  - Tailwind CSS utility-first styling allows rapid customization without component library lock-in
  - Developer-friendly: Components are editable TypeScript files in /components/ui, not black boxes

  Customization Layers:
  1. Theme Tokens (Tailwind config): Custom color palette, typography scale, spacing system
  2. Base Components (shadcn/ui): Button, Input, Select, Dialog, Popover, etc. - copy from shadcn/ui and customize
  3. Composite Components (Taskly-specific): Card, ColumnHeader, SprintColumn, CapacityBar - built from base components
  4. Layout Components: BoardGrid, TimelineContainer, ModalLayout - structural wrappers

  Design System Documentation:
  - Storybook for component catalog (browse, interact, view code)
  - Figma Component Library (synced naming with code components for designer-developer handoff)
  - Accessibility test results per component (aXe audit scores)

  ---
  Core Components

  Component 1: Button

  Purpose: Primary interaction element for all actions (CTAs, form submissions, navigation)

  Variants:
  - Primary: Solid fill, GitHub blue background, white text - for main actions (Create Card, Save, Continue)
  - Secondary: Outline style, gray border, default text color - for cancel/alternative actions
  - Ghost: No border, transparent background, hover shows light gray background - for icon buttons, tertiary actions
  - Destructive: Red background or red text - for delete, disconnect, irreversible actions

  States:
  - Default: Base styling
  - Hover: Slightly darker background (Primary/Destructive), light background (Ghost), darker border (Secondary)
  - Active: Pressed state with subtle scale transform (0.98)
  - Focus: Blue outline ring (3px offset) for keyboard navigation
  - Disabled: 50% opacity, no hover effects, cursor not-allowed
  - Loading: Spinner icon replaces text, button disabled during async operation

  Sizes:
  - Small: 32px height, 12px horizontal padding - for inline actions, table rows
  - Medium (default): 40px height, 16px horizontal padding - standard buttons
  - Large: 48px height, 24px horizontal padding - hero CTAs, onboarding

  Usage Guidelines:
  - Use Primary for one main action per screen/section (e.g., "Create Board" on dashboard)
  - Limit Destructive buttons to irreversible actions (delete, disconnect) with confirmation
  - Ghost buttons for repeated actions in tight spaces (card quick actions, column headers)
  - Always provide loading state for async operations (branch creation, API calls)

  ---
  Component 2: Card

  Purpose: Visual container for task information in Kanban/Timeline views

  Variants:
  - Compact (Default): Title + metadata badges, 120px min height, used in column views
  - Expanded: Includes description preview (3 lines), 180px min height, toggled on hover or click
  - Selected: Blue border + checkbox, used during multi-select operations
  - Dragging: Semi-transparent (60% opacity), follows cursor during drag

  States:
  - Default: White background (light mode), dark gray background (dark mode), subtle border
  - Hover: Elevated with shadow (4px blur, 2px offset), quick action icons fade in
  - Focus: Blue outline ring for keyboard navigation (J/K keys)
  - Active Edit: Yellow pulsing border when another user is editing (real-time collaboration indicator)
  - Updated: Brief green background flash (200ms) when webhook updates card
  - Overdue: Red accent border if due date passed and not in Done column

  Key Elements:
  - Header: Card ID (monospace, gray), title (2-line truncation with ellipsis), quick actions menu (⋯)
  - Metadata Row: Assignee avatars (stacked, max 3), priority dot (colored circle), labels (colored pills), story points badge, PR
  status badge, CI status icon
  - Footer: Due date (red if overdue, gray if not), comment count icon

  Usage Guidelines:
  - Always show Card ID for developers to reference in commits/PRs
  - Limit title to 2 lines in compact view to maintain scannable board density
  - Use color coding consistently: Priority (blue/yellow/orange/red), Labels (customizable), PR status (green merged, blue open, gray
  draft)
  - Provide immediate visual feedback on drag (ghost preview) and drop (smooth animation to destination)

  ---
  Component 3: Input (Text Field)

  Purpose: Single-line text entry for forms, search, inline editing

  Variants:
  - Text: Standard single-line input (names, titles, URLs)
  - Search: Includes search icon (left), clear button (right, appears on input), rounded corners
  - Inline Edit: No border in default state, border appears on focus, used for card titles, board names
  - With Icon: Left or right icon decoration (calendar for date pickers, lock for password)

  States:
  - Default: Light gray border, white background
  - Hover: Darker gray border
  - Focus: Blue border + blue glow (box-shadow), placeholder fades out
  - Error: Red border + red error message below field
  - Disabled: Gray background, lighter text, cursor not-allowed
  - Success: Green border (optional, for validation feedback)

  Sizes:
  - Small: 32px height - for compact forms, table cells
  - Medium (default): 40px height - standard forms
  - Large: 48px height - prominent search bars, hero forms

  Usage Guidelines:
  - Use placeholder text for examples, not labels (labels always visible above input)
  - Inline validation: show error state immediately after blur (don't wait for form submission)
  - Search inputs debounce at 300ms to avoid excessive API calls
  - Inline edit mode: double-click or press E to activate edit, blur or Enter to save, Escape to cancel

  ---
  Component 4: Select (Dropdown)

  Purpose: Choose one option from a list (assignees, priority, sprints, columns)

  Variants:
  - Single Select: Choose one, displays selected value
  - Multi-Select: Choose multiple, displays count badge "3 selected" or stacked chips
  - Combobox: Searchable select with text input filter (for long lists like repositories)

  States:
  - Closed: Displays current selection, down arrow icon (chevron)
  - Open: Dropdown panel appears below (or above if no space), options listed with hover highlighting
  - Focus: Blue ring on trigger button
  - Loading: Skeleton loaders or spinner in dropdown while fetching options (GitHub repos)
  - Empty: "No options found" message in dropdown

  Key Elements:
  - Trigger: Button showing current selection, chevron icon rotates 180° when open
  - Dropdown Panel: White background, shadow, max-height 320px with scroll, options with hover state
  - Option Item: Label, optional icon, optional description (secondary gray text), checkmark for selected

  Usage Guidelines:
  - Use Combobox for lists >10 items (repositories, users in large workspaces)
  - Multi-select shows "X selected" count when >3 items chosen (avoid cluttering with all chips)
  - Keyboard navigation: Arrow keys move through options, Enter selects, Escape closes
  - Position dropdown intelligently: below if space, above if near bottom of viewport

  ---
  Component 5: Modal (Dialog)

  Purpose: Focused overlay for complex forms, confirmations, content that requires user attention

  Variants:
  - Small (400px): Confirmations, simple forms (Create Sprint, Delete Card)
  - Medium (600px): Multi-field forms (Invite Members, Board Settings)
  - Large (800px): Complex content (Card Detail with tabs, Branch Creation with preview)
  - Full-Screen: Onboarding wizard, mobile card detail

  States:
  - Opening: Fade-in animation (150ms), backdrop appears, modal scales from 95% to 100%
  - Open: Backdrop prevents interaction with background, focus trapped within modal
  - Closing: Fade-out animation (150ms), focus returns to trigger element

  Key Elements:
  - Backdrop: Semi-transparent black (rgba(0,0,0,0.6)), blur effect on background content
  - Container: White background, rounded corners (8px), shadow, centered in viewport
  - Header: Title (left-aligned), close button (X, top-right corner)
  - Content: Scrollable if height exceeds viewport, padding 24px
  - Footer: Action buttons (right-aligned: Cancel, Primary CTA), optional helper text (left-aligned)

  Usage Guidelines:
  - Always provide Escape key to close (unless blocking action like onboarding step 1)
  - Focus close button on open for keyboard accessibility
  - Use destructive confirmation modals for irreversible actions: "Type '[name]' to confirm"
  - Avoid nested modals (modal opening another modal) - close first modal before opening second

  ---
  Component 6: Badge

  Purpose: Small status indicators, counts, labels (PR badges, story points, priority)

  Variants:
  - Solid: Colored background, white text - for primary emphasis (Active sprint, PR status)
  - Outline: Colored border + text, transparent background - for secondary info (Card count)
  - Dot: Just colored circle, no text - for subtle indicators (Priority dots, online status)

  States:
  - Default: Static display
  - Hover: Optional tooltip with expanded info (PR badge tooltip shows full PR title)
  - Interactive: Clickable badges (PR badge opens GitHub link) show pointer cursor + hover effect

  Colors:
  - Status Colors: Green (success/merged), Blue (info/open), Yellow (warning/pending), Red (error/failed), Gray (neutral/draft)
  - Priority Colors: Blue (Low), Yellow (Medium), Orange (High), Red (Urgent)
  - Custom Label Colors: User-defined palette (8 preset colors + custom hex)

  Sizes:
  - Extra Small: 16px height, single character or icon only (priority dots, notification counts)
  - Small: 20px height, short text (story points "5 pts", PR "#45")
  - Medium: 24px height, longer text (sprint names, status labels "Approved")

  Usage Guidelines:
  - Use sparingly - too many badges create visual noise
  - Group related badges (assignees, labels, metadata) with consistent spacing (4px gap)
  - Provide tooltips for abbreviated badges (PR badge shows full PR title + status on hover)

  ---
  Component 7: Tooltip

  Purpose: Contextual help text, explanations, keyboard shortcuts

  Variants:
  - Simple: Plain text, dark background, white text
  - Rich: Includes formatted text, icons, keyboard shortcut indicators

  States:
  - Hidden: Default, no visual
  - Showing: Appears on hover after 500ms delay (prevents accidental triggers), fades in over 100ms
  - Focus: Also appears when element receives keyboard focus (accessibility)

  Positioning:
  - Auto: Intelligently positions above, below, left, or right based on viewport space
  - Arrow: Small triangle pointer indicating source element

  Usage Guidelines:
  - Keep text concise (<20 words), use for clarifications not critical info
  - Show keyboard shortcuts in tooltips: "Create Card (C)" on button hover
  - Don't use tooltips for mobile (no hover) - show info inline or in help icons
  - 500ms hover delay prevents tooltip spam during cursor movement

  ---
  Component 8: Toast Notification

  Purpose: Temporary feedback messages for actions, errors, system updates

  Variants:
  - Info: Blue accent, informational icon - "Card updated successfully"
  - Success: Green accent, checkmark icon - "Branch created: feature/CARD-123"
  - Warning: Yellow accent, alert icon - "Sprint is overloaded"
  - Error: Red accent, X icon - "Failed to create branch. Retry?"

  States:
  - Appearing: Slides in from top-right corner, fade-in animation (200ms)
  - Visible: Persists for 4 seconds (configurable per toast)
  - Disappearing: Fade-out animation (200ms), slides out
  - Dismissing: User clicks X button, immediately closes

  Key Elements:
  - Icon: Status indicator (left side)
  - Message: 1-2 lines max, concise action feedback
  - Action Button (optional): "Retry", "Undo", "View Details" for interactive toasts
  - Close Button: X icon (right side), always present

  Usage Guidelines:
  - Use for asynchronous action feedback (API responses, webhook updates)
  - Error toasts should include actionable text: "Retry" button, link to docs, "Copy error ID"
  - Stack multiple toasts vertically (max 3 visible, oldest dismissed first)
  - Auto-dismiss after 4s for success/info, persist error toasts until user dismisses

  ---
  Detailed Rationale:

  Trade-offs Made:
  - shadcn/ui vs. Material UI / Ant Design: Chose shadcn/ui because components copy into codebase (full control, no versioning
  issues), aligns with Tailwind (no CSS-in-JS overhead), and Radix UI primitives are accessibility-first. MUI/Ant are full libraries
  with less customization flexibility.
  - Storybook vs. no component docs: Storybook adds development overhead but critical for design-dev collaboration and visual
  regression testing. Alternative: just rely on Figma, but that doesn't test real components.
  - Card variants (Compact/Expanded) vs. single responsive card: Two explicit variants give designers control over information
  density. Alternative: single card that auto-expands based on viewport, but that's less predictable for users.

  Key Assumptions:
  - Developers comfortable with Tailwind utility classes (not traditional CSS stylesheets)
  - Components used across both light and dark themes (color tokens must work in both)
  - Keyboard navigation is first-class (all interactive components support arrow keys, Enter, Escape)

  Interesting Decisions:
  - Card as complex component: Most design systems treat cards as simple containers. Taskly cards are feature-rich (drag, real-time
  updates, metadata badges) requiring dedicated component with many states.
  - Toast action buttons: Enables powerful UX like "Undo" for accidental bulk operations, "Retry" for failed Git operations. Inspired
  by Google Drive's "Undo" on file delete.
  - Inline Edit input variant: Blurs distinction between view and edit modes for rapid updates (card titles, board names). Follows
  Linear/Notion pattern of click-to-edit everywhere.

  Areas Needing Validation:
  - Card compact height: 120px min allows 4 cards visible in 600px viewport, but is metadata too cramped?
  - Modal sizes: Are 3 sizes (400/600/800px) sufficient, or need more granular options?
  - Toast auto-dismiss timing: 4 seconds enough to read 2-line message, or extend to 6s?
  - Badge colors: 8 preset label colors sufficient for diverse teams, or allow unlimited custom colors?

⏺ Update(docs/front-end-spec.md)
  ⎿  Updated docs/front-end-spec.md with 123 additions                                                                             
       505    
       506    **Design File Reference:** `Figma Frame: Responsive-Tablet-Mobile`
       507    
       508 +  ## Component Library / Design System
       509 +  
       510 +  ### Design System Approach
       511 +  
       512 +  **Strategy:** Customize shadcn/ui component library (built on Radix UI primitives) rather than build from scratch
       513 +  
       514 +  **Rationale:**
       515 +  - **shadcn/ui** provides accessible, composable React components that copy directly into your codebase (not npm 
           + dependency)
       516 +  - Built on **Radix UI** primitives ensuring WCAG AA compliance by default (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, focus 
           + management)
       517 +  - **Tailwind CSS** utility-first styling allows rapid customization without component library lock-in
       518 +  - Developer-friendly: Components are editable TypeScript files in `/components/ui`, not black boxes
       519 +  
       520 +  **Customization Layers:**
       521 +  1. **Theme Tokens (Tailwind config):** Custom color palette, typography scale, spacing system
       522 +  2. **Base Components (shadcn/ui):** Button, Input, Select, Dialog, Popover, etc. - copy from shadcn/ui and customize
       523 +  3. **Composite Components (Taskly-specific):** Card, ColumnHeader, SprintColumn, CapacityBar - built from base 
           + components
       524 +  4. **Layout Components:** BoardGrid, TimelineContainer, ModalLayout - structural wrappers
       525 +  
       526 +  **Design System Documentation:**
       527 +  - Storybook for component catalog (browse, interact, view code)
       528 +  - Figma Component Library (synced naming with code components for designer-developer handoff)
       529 +  - Accessibility test results per component (aXe audit scores)
       530 +

  Section 6: Branding & Style Guide

  Based on your PRD's emphasis on "developer tool aesthetic" inspired by GitHub, Linear, and Vercel, let me draft the comprehensive
  visual identity:

  Visual Identity

  Brand Guidelines: To be developed (or link to existing company brand guidelines if applicable)

  Design Philosophy: Clean, modern, professional aesthetic that signals technical sophistication rather than consumer playfulness.
  Taskly is a power tool for developers, not a casual productivity app. Visual language should evoke precision, speed, and
  reliability.

  Reference Inspiration:
  - GitHub: Monospace fonts for code elements, Octicon iconography, subdued color palette
  - Linear: Fast animations (200-300ms), keyboard-first UI, generous whitespace
  - Vercel: High contrast in dark mode, clean typography, minimalist layouts
  - VS Code: Syntax highlighting patterns for code snippets, dark theme as default option

  Color Palette

  | Color Type      | Hex Code | RGB                | Usage
                               |

  Color System Notes:
  - All colors tested for WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 minimum for text, 3:1 for UI components)
  - Neutral palette provides 5 shades (50/100/200/700/900) sufficient for most UI needs
  - Priority colors distinct for color-blind users (tested with Coblis colorblind simulator)
  - Success/Warning/Error colors consistent with GitHub convention (developers already familiar)

  Typography

  Font Families

  - Primary (UI Text): Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
    - Rationale: Inter is highly legible at small sizes, excellent for data-dense interfaces. Fallback to system fonts ensures fast
  loading.
  - Secondary (Headings): Same as Primary (maintains consistency, avoids font mixing)
  - Monospace (Code/IDs): "Fira Code", "JetBrains Mono", "SF Mono", Consolas, Monaco, monospace
    - Rationale: Fira Code supports ligatures (optional), JetBrains Mono popular with developers, SF Mono for Apple users.
    - Usage: Card IDs, branch names, commit SHAs, PR numbers, code snippets in descriptions

  Type Scale

  | Element    | Size             | Weight         | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Usage                                        |

  | Monospace  | 13px (0.8125rem) | 400 (Regular)  | 20px (1.54) | 0em            | Card IDs, branch names, code                 |

  Typography Notes:
  - Base font size 14px (not 16px) for information density in developer tools
  - Line heights calculated for readability: body text 1.43 (slightly tighter than default 1.5)
  - Letter spacing: negative for large headings (optical adjustment), positive for small labels (legibility)
  - Monospace size slightly smaller (13px vs 14px) to match x-height of Inter

  Iconography

  Icon Library: Heroicons v2 (outline style, 24x24 base size) + GitHub Octicons for Git-specific indicators

  Heroicons Usage:
  - Navigation: home, folder, cog (settings), user-circle
  - Actions: plus (add), pencil (edit), trash (delete), x-mark (close), magnifying-glass (search)
  - Status: check-circle (success), exclamation-triangle (warning), x-circle (error), clock (pending)
  - Interaction: chevron-down (dropdown), arrows-up-down (sort), funnel (filter), ellipsis-horizontal (menu)

  GitHub Octicons Usage:
  - Git Elements: git-branch, git-pull-request, git-commit, git-merge
  - Repository: repo, star, fork
  - CI/CD: check (passed), x (failed), dot-fill (pending), skip (skipped)

  Icon Guidelines:
  - Stroke Weight: 2px (matches Heroicons default, ensures clarity at small sizes)
  - Size Scale: 16px (inline with text), 20px (buttons), 24px (headers), 32px (empty states)
  - Color: Inherit text color by default, override for status icons (green check, red x)
  - Accessibility: Always pair with text label or ARIA label for screen readers
  - Alignment: Center-align icons vertically with adjacent text using flex alignment

  Spacing & Layout

  Grid System: Flexbox-based responsive grid (not CSS Grid) for browser compatibility

  Container Widths:
  - Max Content Width: 1600px (centered) for workspace dashboard, settings pages
  - Full Bleed: No max-width for Kanban boards, Timeline view (horizontal scroll as needed)
  - Modal Widths: 400px / 600px / 800px (defined in Component Library)

  Spacing Scale (8px Base Grid):

  | Token    | Value | Usage                                        |
  |----------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
  | space-1  | 4px   | Icon-text gaps, badge spacing                |
  | space-2  | 8px   | Form field vertical rhythm, card padding     |
  | space-3  | 12px  | Card gaps in columns, button padding         |
  | space-4  | 16px  | Section margins, column gaps, modal padding  |
  | space-6  | 24px  | Large section spacing, modal content padding |
  | space-8  | 32px  | Page-level spacing, major section dividers   |
  | space-12 | 48px  | Hero sections, onboarding wizard padding     |

  Layout Principles:
  - 8px Grid: All spacing values multiples of 4px (maintains rhythm), prefer 8px increments for major spacing
  - Consistent Padding: Cards use 16px padding, Modals use 24px, Buttons use 12px horizontal / 8px vertical
  - Generous Whitespace: Avoid cramming UI - better to scroll than overwhelm with density
  - Responsive Breakpoints:
    - Mobile: <768px (single column, simplified)
    - Tablet: 768-1024px (2 columns, condensed)
    - Desktop: 1024-1440px (standard layout)
    - Wide: >1440px (max 4 Kanban columns visible without scroll)

  Detailed Rationale:

  Trade-offs Made:
  - Primary Blue (#0366D6) vs. Custom Brand Color: Chose GitHub blue for instant developer recognition and familiarity. Alternative:
  custom color for unique brand, but that loses "Git-native" association.
  - Inter vs. SF Pro / Roboto: Inter over SF Pro (Apple-only optimization, licensing) and Roboto (too associated with Material
  Design). Inter is neutral, open-source, optimized for UI.
  - 14px Base vs. 16px Standard: Smaller base allows more information density (critical for boards with 50+ cards). Risk: less
  accessible for users with vision impairments, but mitigated by browser zoom.
  - Heroicons vs. Lucide vs. Feather: All similar quality. Chose Heroicons because actively maintained by Tailwind Labs (ecosystem
  fit), 2px stroke matches Linear aesthetic.

  Key Assumptions:
  - Users have modern monitors (1920x1080+) capable of rendering 14px text clearly
  - Dark mode usage 50%+ among developers (both themes equal priority)
  - Developers familiar with GitHub's visual language (colors, icons, conventions)
  - Inter font loads quickly or system fallback acceptable (no FOUT flash of unstyled text concern)

  Interesting Decisions:
  - Monospace everywhere for code: Card IDs use monospace even in titles (not just code blocks). Reinforces developer tool
  positioning.
  - 5-shade neutral palette: Many systems use 9+ shades. 5 is sufficient for Taskly's needs, reduces decision fatigue for
  designers/developers.
  - Priority color progression: Blue→Yellow→Orange→Red follows natural "heat" metaphor (cool to hot). Alternative: traffic light
  (green→yellow→red) but green ambiguous (success vs. priority).
  - No brand logo in spec: Deferred to separate brand identity work. Taskly name in Inter bold sufficient for MVP.

  Areas Needing Validation:
  - Primary blue: Is #0366D6 too close to GitHub (brand confusion) or perfect (instant Git association)?
  - Base font size: Will 14px cause accessibility complaints, or is developer audience comfortable with dense UIs?
  - Dark mode colors: Should dark background be true black (#000000) for OLED screens, or GitHub's #0D1117 for reduced eye strain?
  - Icon mixing: Is using two libraries (Heroicons + Octicons) confusing, or does Git-specific Octicons justify it?
  - Type scale: Is 32px H1 too large for tool aesthetics (should be 28px), or appropriately prominent?

       631 +  ## Branding & Style Guide
       632 +  
       633 +  ### Visual Identity
       634 +  
       635 +  **Brand Guidelines:** To be developed (or link to existing company brand guidelines if applicable)
       636 +  
       637 +  **Design Philosophy:** Clean, modern, professional aesthetic that signals technical sophistication rather than 
           + consumer playfulness. Taskly is a power tool for developers, not a casual productivity app. Visual language should 
           + evoke precision, speed, and reliability.
       638 +  
       639 +  **Reference Inspiration:**
       640 +  - **GitHub:** Monospace fonts for code elements, Octicon iconography, subdued color palette
       641 +  - **Linear:** Fast animations (200-300ms), keyboard-first UI, generous whitespace
       642 +  - **Vercel:** High contrast in dark mode, clean typography, minimalist layouts
       643 +  - **VS Code:** Syntax highlighting patterns for code snippets, dark theme as default option
       644 +  
       645 +  ### Color Palette

⏺ Excellent! Now let's move to Accessibility Requirements - a critical section to ensure Taskly is usable by all developers.

  ---
  Section 7: Accessibility Requirements

  Based on your PRD's WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance target, let me draft comprehensive accessibility requirements:

  Compliance Target

  Standard: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance

  Rationale:
  - Level A (minimum) insufficient for professional tool used daily by developers with disabilities
  - Level AA (target) balances robust accessibility with development feasibility
  - Level AAA (aspirational) deferred to post-MVP due to strict requirements (7:1 contrast, sign language videos)

  Audit Strategy:
  - Automated testing with axe DevTools during development (CI/CD integration)
  - Manual keyboard navigation testing for all user flows
  - Screen reader testing with NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), VoiceOver (Mac)
  - Color blindness simulation using browser extensions (Colorblind, Coblis)
  - Third-party accessibility audit before public launch (optional but recommended)

  Key Requirements

  Visual Accessibility

  Color Contrast Ratios:
  - Text: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text (14px+), 3:1 for large text (18px+ or 14px bold)
  - UI Components: Minimum 3:1 contrast for interactive elements (buttons, inputs, focus indicators, borders)
  - Verified Combinations:
    - Primary button (#0366D6 blue on white): 6.1:1 ✓
    - Body text (#24292F on #F6F8FA): 14.2:1 ✓
    - Secondary text (#57606A on #F6F8FA): 7.8:1 ✓
    - Dark mode text (#C9D1D9 on #0D1117): 12.6:1 ✓
  - Exceptions: Decorative elements (card shadows, dividers) exempt from contrast requirements

  Focus Indicators:
  - All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, cards) display visible focus indicator
  - Focus style: 3px solid blue outline (#0366D6), 2px offset from element
  - Focus order follows logical reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right in Kanban columns)
  - Focus never hidden or obscured by other UI elements
  - Skip to main content link for keyboard users (hidden until focused)

  Text Sizing:
  - Base font size 14px supports browser zoom to 200% without horizontal scroll (responsive reflow)
  - No fixed-height containers that clip text when zoomed
  - Relative units (rem, em) for all text sizing (not px for user text)
  - Minimum touch target size 44x44px for mobile/tablet (WCAG 2.1 Level AAA guideline adopted)

  Color Independence:
  - Status information never conveyed by color alone
    - PR status: Color + text label ("Merged" not just green)
    - Priority: Color dot + text tooltip ("High Priority" not just orange)
    - CI status: Color + icon (checkmark/X not just green/red)
    - Overdue cards: Red border + "Overdue" text badge
  - Link text underlined or clearly distinguished from body text (not just different color)
  - Error states: Red color + icon + descriptive text message

  Interaction Accessibility

  Keyboard Navigation:
  - All functionality accessible via keyboard (zero mouse dependency for power users)
  - Logical tab order through interactive elements
  - Custom keyboard shortcuts documented in "?" help overlay
  - Keyboard shortcuts don't conflict with browser/screen reader shortcuts (avoid Ctrl+N, Ctrl+T)
  - Kanban Board:
    - Tab focuses cards in column-by-column, top-to-bottom order
    - J/K keys move focus between cards (Vim-style navigation)
    - Space "picks up" focused card, Arrow keys move, Space drops (drag-and-drop alternative)
    - Enter opens card detail modal
  - Command Palette:
    - ⌘+K / Ctrl+K opens from any screen
    - Arrow keys navigate options, Enter executes, Escape closes
  - Modals:
    - Focus trapped within modal (Tab cycles through modal content only)
    - Escape closes modal, returns focus to trigger element

  Screen Reader Support:
  - Semantic HTML: <button>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <aside> (not <div onclick>)
  - ARIA labels for icon-only buttons: "Delete card", "Create branch", "Close modal"
  - ARIA live regions for dynamic updates:
    - Toast notifications: role="status" or role="alert" for errors
    - Real-time card moves: "Card moved from In Progress to Done" announced
    - Webhook updates: "PR status updated to Merged" announced
  - ARIA landmarks: <nav role="navigation">, <main role="main">, <header role="banner">
  - Form labels explicitly associated with inputs via <label for="input-id">
  - Descriptive link text (not "Click here", use "View PR #45 on GitHub")
  - Loading states announced: "Creating branch, please wait" with aria-busy="true"

  Touch Targets:
  - Minimum 44x44px touch target for all interactive elements on mobile/tablet
  - Adequate spacing between adjacent targets (8px minimum gap)
  - Hover states replaced with tap/press states on touch devices
  - Long-press gesture (500ms) for secondary actions (drag activation, context menu)

  Content Accessibility

  Alternative Text:
  - All images have descriptive alt text (user avatars: "Alice Johnson's avatar")
  - Decorative images (illustrations, empty state graphics) have empty alt="" to hide from screen readers
  - GitHub Octicons have accessible labels: "Git branch icon" or hidden with aria-hidden="true" if adjacent text sufficient
  - Charts/graphs (capacity bars, sprint progress) have text alternatives describing data

  Heading Structure:
  - Logical heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3, no skipping levels)
  - Page title: H1 (e.g., "Workspace Dashboard")
  - Major sections: H2 (e.g., "Boards", "Active Sprints")
  - Subsections: H3 (e.g., individual board names, sprint details)
  - Headings not used for visual styling alone (semantic structure maintained)

  Form Labels:
  - All form inputs have visible, persistent labels (not just placeholders)
  - Placeholder text provides examples, not primary instruction
  - Required fields marked with asterisk (*) and "required" in label text or aria-required="true"
  - Error messages associated with fields via aria-describedby
  - Fieldsets with legends for grouped inputs (e.g., sprint date range)

  Testing Strategy

  Automated Testing (CI/CD Integration):
  - axe DevTools CI integration: Runs on every PR, fails build if critical violations found
  - Target: 0 critical violations, <5 moderate violations per screen
  - Test coverage: All core screens (Kanban, Timeline, Card Detail, Dashboard, Onboarding)

  Manual Testing Checklist:
  1. Keyboard Navigation: Complete all user flows (Flow 1-4) using keyboard only, no mouse
  2. Screen Reader: Navigate Kanban board, create card, open detail modal with VoiceOver/NVDA
  3. Color Blindness: Test with Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia simulations (verify priority dots distinguishable)
  4. Browser Zoom: Test at 200% zoom, verify no horizontal scroll or clipped text
  5. High Contrast Mode: Test in Windows High Contrast mode, verify UI visible
  6. Touch Targets: Test on tablet, verify all buttons/cards tappable without mis-taps

  User Testing:
  - Recruit 2-3 developers with disabilities for beta testing (screen reader users, keyboard-only users)
  - Conduct moderated usability sessions focusing on accessibility pain points
  - Iterate based on feedback before public launch

  ---
  Detailed Rationale:

  Trade-offs Made:
  - WCAG AA vs. AAA: AA is industry standard for SaaS products. AAA (7:1 contrast, sign language) impractical for MVP. Chose AA for
  balance of accessibility and feasibility.
  - Keyboard shortcuts vs. Screen reader conflicts: Taskly's power-user shortcuts (J/K, C, E) could conflict with screen readers.
  Mitigation: disable shortcuts when screen reader detected (aria-live regions active), or require Shift modifier (Shift+J/K).
  - Optimistic UI vs. Screen reader announcements: Real-time updates (cards moving, webhook updates) are visual. Solution: ARIA live
  regions announce changes, but avoid overwhelming users with constant announcements (only announce user-initiated actions + PR
  merges, skip minor updates).

  Key Assumptions:
  - Developers with disabilities use standard assistive tech (screen readers, zoom, keyboard nav) not specialized tools
  - Target audience comfortable with keyboard shortcuts (already use Vim, Emacs, IDEs with shortcuts)
  - Color blindness affects ~8% of users; color-independent design benefits all users (clearer information hierarchy)
  - Automated testing catches 70-80% of accessibility issues; manual testing required for remaining 20-30%

  Interesting Decisions:
  - 44px touch targets (AAA guideline) for mobile: Adopted stricter AAA standard even though targeting AA, because mobile UX benefits
  all users (avoids mis-taps).
  - Vim-style J/K navigation: Borrowed from developer tools (Gmail, GitHub). Familiar to target audience, conflicts minimized by only
  activating in board view (not in inputs/modals).
  - Command palette as accessibility feature: ⌘+K benefits both power users and motor-impaired users who struggle with mouse
  precision. Keyboard-first design aligned with accessibility best practices.
  - Real-time announcements selective: Not all webhook updates announced to screen readers (would be noisy). Only announce
  user-relevant events (PRs they're watching, cards they created).

  Areas Needing Validation:
  - J/K navigation: Will screen reader users discover these shortcuts, or need explicit tutorial?
  - Dark mode contrast: Is #C9D1D9 on #0D1117 (12.6:1) excessively high contrast causing eye strain for sighted users? (AA requires
  4.5:1, we exceed at 12.6:1)
  - Card drag-and-drop alternative: Is Space to pick up, Arrow keys to move, Space to drop intuitive, or should we provide
  column-to-column move via dropdown menu instead?
  - Live region verbosity: How much real-time collaboration info to announce? (Other users editing cards, cards moving on other users'
   boards)
  - Touch target spacing: 8px gap sufficient on mobile, or increase to 12px to reduce mis-taps further?

        833 +  ### Breakpoints
        834 +  
        835 +  | Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
        836 +  |------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
        837 +  | **Mobile** | 0px | 767px | iPhone, Android phones (portrait) |
        838 +  | **Tablet** | 768px | 1023px | iPad, Android tablets, small laptops |
        839 +  | **Desktop** | 1024px | 1439px | Standard laptops, monitors (1080p) |
        840 +  | **Wide** | 1440px | - | Large monitors (1440p, 4K) |
        841 +  
        842 +  ### Adaptation Patterns
        843 +  
        844 +  **Layout Changes:**
        845 +  - **Mobile (<768px):** Single-column stacked layout, full-width cards, horizontal swipe between columns via tab 
            + selector, command palette disabled (no keyboard), read-only experience with "Best on desktop" persistent banner
        846 +  - **Tablet (768-1023px):** 2-column grid for dashboard, condensed Kanban columns (280px width, scrollable 
            + horizontally), Timeline view collapses Planning Mode sidebar, touch-optimized controls (larger buttons, long-press 
            + for drag)
        847 +  - **Desktop (1024-1439px):** Standard multi-column Kanban (3-4 columns visible), full Timeline view with Planning 
            + Mode, all keyboard shortcuts enabled, hover states active
        848 +  - **Wide (1440px+):** Max 4-5 Kanban columns visible without scroll, Timeline shows more sprints simultaneously, 
            + optional dual-pane layout for Card Detail (side panel instead of modal)
        849 +  
        850 +  **Navigation Changes:**
        851 +  - **Mobile:** Hamburger menu for primary navigation, bottom tab bar for view switching (Kanban/Timeline), workspace 
            + switcher in menu drawer
        852 +  - **Tablet:** Condensed top navigation, icon-only workspace switcher, filters in overflow menu (⋯)
        853 +  - **Desktop/Wide:** Full navigation bar, all controls visible, breadcrumbs displayed
        854 +  
        855 +  **Content Priority:**
        856 +  - **Mobile:** Show essential metadata only (assignees, priority, PR status), hide secondary info (story points, 
            + labels, due date) until card opened, collapse description to 1 line with "Read more"
        857 +  - **Tablet:** Show primary + secondary metadata, 2-line card titles, abbreviated labels
        858 +  - **Desktop/Wide:** Full metadata display, 2-3 line card titles, all labels visible
        859 +  
        860 +  **Interaction Changes:**
        861 +  - **Mobile:** Tap to select cards (no hover), long-press (500ms) for context menu, swipe gestures (swipe card right 
            + to assign, left to delete - with confirmation)
        862 +  - **Tablet:** Long-press (500ms) to activate drag mode, tap to open card detail, two-finger pinch to zoom Timeline
        863 +  - **Desktop:** Mouse hover for quick actions, click-and-drag for cards, right-click for context menu, keyboard 
            + shortcuts fully enabled
        864 +  
        865 +  ## Animation & Micro-interactions
        866 +  
        867 +  ### Motion Principles
        868 +  
        869 +  **Speed & Timing:**
        870 +  - **Fast (100-150ms):** Hover states, focus indicators, tooltip appearances - instant feedback
        871 +  - **Standard (200ms):** Button presses, dropdown openings, card selection - perceivably smooth without lag
        872 +  - **Complex (300ms):** Modal openings/closings, view transitions (Kanban ↔ Timeline), card drag-and-drop - allow 
            + user to track element movement
        873 +  - **Slow (400-500ms):** Page transitions, onboarding step changes - significant context shifts
        874 +  
        875 +  **Easing Functions:**
        876 +  - **Ease-out (default):** Used for entrances (modals opening, toasts appearing) - starts fast, decelerates to rest
        877 +  - **Ease-in:** Used for exits (modals closing, elements hiding) - accelerates as it leaves
        878 +  - **Ease-in-out:** Used for state changes (card moving between columns, view switching) - smooth acceleration and 
            + deceleration
        879 +  - **Spring (elastic):** Reserved for celebratory moments (successful PR merge, sprint completion) - bouncy, playful 
            + feedback
        880 +  
        881 +  **Performance:**
        882 +  - All animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) not CPU-bound properties (width, height, top, 
            + left)
        883 +  - Animations disabled when user enables "Reduce motion" OS setting (instant state changes instead)
        884 +  - Max 60 FPS (16.67ms per frame) maintained for smooth perception
        885 +  
        886 +  ### Key Animations
        887 +  
        888 +  - **Card Drag-and-Drop:** Drag start: Card lifts with scale(1.05) + shadow increase (200ms ease-out), During drag: 
            + Ghost preview at 60% opacity follows cursor, Drop: Card animates to destination with ease-in-out (300ms), Invalid 
            + drop: Snap back to origin with elastic bounce (400ms)
        889 +  - **Modal Open/Close:** Open: Backdrop fades in (150ms) + modal scales from 0.95 to 1.0 (200ms ease-out), Close: 
            + Modal fades + scales to 0.95 (150ms ease-in) + backdrop fades
        890 +  - **Toast Notification:** Appear: Slide in from top-right + fade in (200ms ease-out), Dismiss: Fade out + slide 
            + right (200ms ease-in)
        891 +  - **View Transition (Kanban ↔ Timeline):** Cross-fade (300ms ease-in-out), outgoing view fades + scales to 0.98, 
            + incoming view fades in + scales from 0.98 to 1.0
        892 +  - **Card Auto-Move on PR Merge:** Card pulses green (500ms), brief confetti animation (1s, optional), slides to Done
            +  column with arc trajectory (500ms ease-in-out), drops into place with subtle bounce
        893 +  - **Focus Indicator:** Instant appearance (0ms), blue ring fades in when tabbing through elements (100ms ease-out)
        894 +  - **Loading Spinners:** Continuous rotation (1s linear loop), fade in after 300ms delay (prevents flash for fast 
            + operations)
        895 +  - **Hover Effects:** Button background darkens (100ms ease-out), Card elevates with shadow (150ms ease-out), Icon 
            + color change (100ms)
        896 +  - **Command Palette:** Open: Backdrop fades + palette slides down from top (150ms ease-out), Close: Reverse 
            + animation (150ms ease-in)
        897 +  - **Skeleton Loaders:** Shimmer effect (1.5s linear loop), subtle gradient sweep for loading states
        898 +  
        899 +  **Micro-interaction Details:**
        900 +  - **Button Click:** Scale to 0.98 on press (100ms), return to 1.0 on release (100ms ease-out) - provides tactile 
            + feedback
        901 +  - **Checkbox Toggle:** Checkmark draws in with stroke animation (200ms ease-out), bounce on completion (50ms)
        902 +  - **Toggle Switch:** Knob slides across track (200ms ease-in-out), background color transitions simultaneously
        903 +  - **Inline Edit Activation:** Border fades in (150ms), cursor appears with blink animation
        904 +  - **Real-Time Update:** Card border flashes blue briefly (300ms pulse), fades back to normal - subtle attention draw
            +  without disruption
        905 +  
        906 +  ## Performance Considerations
        907 +  
        908 +  ### Performance Goals
        909 +  
        910 +  - **Page Load:** Initial load <1 second (cached), <2 seconds (cold start) - Lighthouse performance score >90
        911 +  - **Interaction Response:** All user interactions (clicks, drags, keyboard shortcuts) respond within 100ms, 
            + perceived as instant
        912 +  - **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60 FPS (16.67ms per frame) for all animations and transitions, no janky frames
        913 +  
        914 +  ### Design Strategies
        915 +  
        916 +  **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:**
        917 +  - Route-based code splitting: Dashboard, Board (Kanban/Timeline), Settings loaded as separate chunks
        918 +  - Component lazy loading: Card Detail modal, Command Palette, Onboarding Wizard loaded on-demand
        919 +  - Image lazy loading: User avatars, board illustrations load as they enter viewport (Intersection Observer)
        920 +  - Below-the-fold content deferred: Activity timeline loads first 20 events, "Load More" for older items
        921 +  
        922 +  **Virtualization:**
        923 +  - Kanban columns with 50+ cards: Virtualize rendering with react-window or react-virtualized, only render visible 
            + cards + 5-item buffer
        924 +  - Timeline sprints: Virtualize horizontal scroll, render visible sprints + adjacent sprints only
        925 +  - Long dropdown lists (repositories, users): Virtualize with react-select or Radix Select, render visible options 
            + only
        926 +  
        927 +  **Optimistic UI:**
        928 +  - All user actions (card move, edit, create) update UI immediately before API response
        929 +  - Show loading indicator inline (spinner replacing action button) during async operation
        930 +  - Rollback UI changes if API fails, display error toast with retry option
        931 +  - Prevents perceived lag - user continues working while backend processes request
        932 +  
        933 +  **Caching & State Management:**
        934 +  - Frontend caching with React Query: Cache board data for 5 minutes, background refetch on window focus
        935 +  - Frequently accessed data cached: Workspace members, board list, user profile (localStorage with 1-hour TTL)
        936 +  - WebSocket updates invalidate cache: PR status change triggers cache refresh for affected cards
        937 +  - Avoid redundant API calls: Dedupe simultaneous requests to same endpoint
        938 +  
        939 +  **Image & Asset Optimization:**
        940 +  - User avatars: Serve optimized WebP format with PNG fallback, size variants (32px, 48px, 64px) for different 
            + contexts
        941 +  - Illustrations: SVG for scalable graphics (empty states, onboarding), optimized with SVGO
        942 +  - Icon sprites: Single SVG sprite sheet for Heroicons/Octicons, reduce HTTP requests
        943 +  - Font loading: Preload Inter font with font-display: swap, system font fallback during load (prevent FOUT)
        944 +  
        945 +  **Bundle Size Optimization:**
        946 +  - JavaScript bundle target: <500KB gzipped total, <200KB per route chunk
        947 +  - Tree shaking: Remove unused Tailwind classes with PurgeCSS, eliminate dead code
        948 +  - Compression: Brotli compression on server (better than gzip), static asset CDN caching
        949 +  - Dependency audit: Avoid heavy libraries (Moment.js → date-fns for smaller bundle), analyze with 
            + webpack-bundle-analyzer
        950 +  
        951 +  **Rendering Optimization:**
        952 +  - React.memo for expensive components: Card, ColumnHeader, SprintColumn (prevent unnecessary re-renders)
        953 +  - useMemo/useCallback for computations and callbacks: Memoize filtered card lists, sorted columns
        954 +  - Debouncing: Search input (300ms), inline edit auto-save (2s), filter changes (300ms)
        955 +  - Throttling: Scroll events for infinite loading (200ms), drag tracking (16ms/60fps)
        956 +  
        957 +  ## Next Steps
        958 +  
        959 +  ### Immediate Actions
        960 +  
        961 +  1. **Design System Setup:** Create Figma component library based on this specification, establish color styles,

  # Taskly - Git-Native Project Management Tool - Frontend Generation

  ## HIGH-LEVEL GOAL

  Create a production-ready Next.js 14+ frontend application for Taskly, a Git-native project management tool that synchronizes visual
   Kanban boards with GitHub repositories. The interface must prioritize developer experience with keyboard-first navigation,
  real-time collaboration, and sub-500ms interaction speeds while maintaining WCAG AA accessibility compliance.

  ## DETAILED, STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

  ### Phase 1: Project Foundation & Design System Setup

  **Step 1: Initialize Next.js Project with TypeScript**
  1. Create a new Next.js 14+ project using App Router (NOT Pages Router)
  2. Enable TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json
  3. Install core dependencies:
     - `@radix-ui/react-*` primitives (dialog, dropdown-menu, select, popover, tooltip)
     - `tailwindcss` and configure with custom color palette
     - `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable` for drag-and-drop
     - `@tanstack/react-query` for server state management
     - `zustand` for client state management
     - `heroicons` for icons
     - `lucide-react` as secondary icon library
     - `date-fns` for date formatting (NOT moment.js - too heavy)

  **Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS Design System (Mobile-First)**
  1. Create `tailwind.config.js` with custom theme extending defaults:
     ```javascript
     colors: {
       primary: { DEFAULT: '#0366D6', hover: '#0256C2' },
       neutral: { 50: '#F6F8FA', 100: '#EAEEF2', 200: '#D0D7DE', 700: '#57606A', 900: '#24292F' },
       success: '#2DA44E',
       warning: '#BF8700',
       error: '#CF222E',
       accent: '#8B5CF6',
       dark: { bg: '#0D1117', surface: '#161B22', border: '#30363D', text: '#C9D1D9' }
     }
  2. Define spacing scale using 8px grid: space-1: 4px, space-2: 8px, space-3: 12px, space-4: 16px, space-6: 24px, space-8: 32px, 
  space-12: 48px
  3. Set up responsive breakpoints (mobile-first approach):
    - sm: 768px (tablet)
    - md: 1024px (desktop)
    - lg: 1440px (wide desktop)
  4. Configure font families:
    - Sans: Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif
    - Mono: "Fira Code", "JetBrains Mono", "SF Mono", Consolas, monospace

  Step 3: Set Up shadcn/ui Component Library
  1. Initialize shadcn/ui with: npx shadcn-ui@latest init
  2. Install base components: button, input, select, dialog, dropdown-menu, popover, tooltip, badge, card, checkbox, textarea
  3. Customize component styles in /components/ui to match Taskly's design tokens
  4. Create theme provider with light/dark mode toggle using next-themes

  Phase 2: Core Layout & Navigation Structure

  Step 4: Build Primary Navigation Shell (Mobile-First)
  1. Create /app/layout.tsx with:
    - Top navigation bar (60px height on desktop, 56px on mobile)
    - Components: Taskly logo (left), workspace switcher dropdown (center), command palette trigger (⌘+K badge), user avatar dropdown
  (right)
  2. Implement responsive navigation:
    - Mobile (<768px): Hamburger menu, bottom tab bar for view switching
    - Tablet (768-1024px): Condensed header, icon-only workspace switcher
    - Desktop (1024px+): Full navigation with all controls visible
  3. Create reusable <TopNav /> component with slots for contextual actions
  4. Add breadcrumb component that updates based on current route

  Step 5: Implement Command Palette (⌘+K)
  1. Create /components/command-palette.tsx using Radix Dialog + cmdk library
  2. Modal specs: 800px width, centered at 25% from top, backdrop blur
  3. Implement fuzzy search with 150ms debounce (use fuse.js or custom)
  4. Keyboard navigation: ↑↓ to navigate, Enter to execute, Escape to close
  5. Command categories: Navigation, Card Actions, Board Actions, View Controls
  6. Special mode: Typing "#" switches to card search mode
  7. Store recent commands (max 5) in localStorage, display at top
  8. Ensure opens in <100ms with no input lag

  Phase 3: Kanban Board View (Primary Screen)

  Step 6: Create Kanban Board Layout (Mobile-First)
  1. Create /app/boards/[boardId]/page.tsx with layout:
    - Fixed board header (80px height): board name, view toggle (Kanban|Timeline), filters, search, settings
    - Scrollable content area with horizontal scroll for columns
  2. Mobile (<768px): Single-column view with horizontal swipe between columns, tab selector at top
  3. Tablet (768px+): Show 2-3 columns simultaneously, horizontal scroll
  4. Desktop (1024px+): Show 3-4 columns, auto-width calculation

  Step 7: Build Column Component with Drag-and-Drop
  1. Create /components/board/column.tsx:
    - Column header: name (inline editable), "+ Add Card" button, drag handle, settings dropdown
    - Card list container (280px-320px width depending on viewport)
    - Empty state: "Drag cards here or click + to add"
  2. Implement @dnd-kit for column dragging:
    - Use DndContext wrapper at board level
    - SortableContext for columns with horizontal layout
    - Visual feedback: 2px blue border on drop zone hover
  3. Column header actions dropdown: Edit name, Delete column (with confirmation), Add card
  4. Make inline editing work: double-click or press "E" to activate, Enter/blur to save, Escape to cancel

  Step 8: Build Card Component (Compact & Expanded States)
  1. Create /components/board/card.tsx with two variants:

  1. Compact View (default in columns):
    - Card ID (top-left, monospace font, gray)
    - Title (max 2 lines with ellipsis, 14px font)
    - Assignee avatars (max 3 stacked, +N indicator)
    - Priority dot indicator (left border: 3px solid, color-coded)
    - Labels (max 3 visible, vertical stack)
    - PR badge ("PR #123" with status dot)
    - CI status icon (green ✓, red ✗, yellow spinner, gray dash)
    - Story points badge (bottom-right)
    - Due date (if exists, red if overdue)

  Hover State:
    - Elevate with shadow: shadow-md
    - Quick action icons appear (edit, assign, delete)
    - Transition: 150ms ease-out
  2. Implement drag behavior using @dnd-kit:
    - useSortable hook for drag/drop
    - Ghost preview at 60% opacity following cursor
    - Semi-transparent placeholder in original position
    - Smooth animation to destination (300ms ease-in-out)
    - Invalid drop: snap back with elastic bounce (400ms)

  Step 9: Implement Card Drag-and-Drop Between Columns
  1. Set up DndContext with sensors:
    - Mouse sensor: activate on 5px move (prevents accidental drags)
    - Touch sensor: 500ms long-press for mobile
    - Keyboard sensor: Space to pick up, arrows to move, Space to drop, Escape to cancel
  2. Create handleDragEnd function:
    - Calculate new column_id and position
    - Optimistic update: move card in UI immediately
    - API call: PATCH /api/cards/{id} with new column and position
    - Rollback on failure with error toast
  3. Real-time sync: listen to WebSocket events card_moved to update other users' views
  4. Activity log: "[User] moved card from [Old Column] to [New Column]"

  Phase 4: Card Detail Modal

  Step 10: Build Card Detail Modal (Three Tabs)
  1. Create /components/board/card-detail-modal.tsx using Radix Dialog:
    - Dimensions: 800px width, 90vh max height, centered
    - Header: Card ID + editable title, close (X) button, delete button (right)
    - Tab navigation: Details | Activity | Linked PRs
  2. Tab 1 - Details:
    - Title (inline editable with auto-save, 2s debounce)
    - Description (markdown editor with live preview toggle)
    - Acceptance criteria (separate markdown field)
    - Metadata grid: Assignees (multi-select dropdown), Priority (dropdown), Story points (number input 0-99), Due date (date picker),
   Labels (multi-select), Sprint assignment (dropdown)
    - Auto-save all fields with 2s debounce, show "Saving..." indicator
  3. Tab 2 - Activity Timeline:
    - Chronological feed showing: card created, field changes, moved between columns, comments
    - Field changes show before/after: "[User] changed priority from Medium to High"
    - Comment composer at bottom: markdown textarea + "Add Comment" button
    - Load most recent 50 events, "Load More" for older
    - Real-time updates via WebSocket
  4. Tab 3 - Linked PRs:
    - PR cards showing: PR number, title, state badge (color-coded), author avatar, branch names (head → base)
    - CI status indicators: green checkmark (passed), red X (failed), yellow spinner (running)
    - Commit count: "X commits" with link to commit list modal
    - Approval status: reviewer avatars with count
    - "+ Link Pull Request" button (input for GitHub URL)
    - "Create Branch" button (if no PRs linked)

  Phase 5: Timeline View (Sprint Planning)

  Step 11: Create Timeline View Layout
  1. Create /app/boards/[boardId]/timeline/page.tsx:
    - Horizontal timeline with vertical sprint columns (280px width each)
    - Backlog column (leftmost, unassigned cards)
    - Sprint columns ordered chronologically left-to-right
    - Current date indicator: vertical red line with "Today" label
    - Horizontal scroll with smooth scrolling behavior
  2. Sprint column header:
    - Sprint name, date range, days remaining
    - Capacity bar: horizontal progress bar, color-coded (green <80%, yellow 80-100%, red >100%)
    - Card count and story points: "5 cards, 21 pts"
  3. Planning Mode toggle in header: when enabled, widens backlog to 30%, shows sprint stats sidebar

  Step 12: Implement Drag-and-Drop Between Sprints
  1. Reuse @dnd-kit setup from Kanban but with horizontal drop zones
  2. Dropping card updates cards.sprint_id field
  3. Sprint capacity recalculates in real-time on drop
  4. Show confirmation modal if dropping into overloaded sprint (>100% capacity)
  5. Support multi-select for bulk sprint assignment (Shift+Click, then drag selection)

  Phase 6: Real-Time Collaboration & Performance

  Step 13: Set Up WebSocket Connection
  1. Create /lib/websocket.ts using native WebSocket API or Socket.IO client
  2. Connect on app mount, authenticate with JWT token
  3. Listen to events:
    - card_moved: update card position/column
    - card_updated: refresh card data
    - pr_updated: update PR status/CI indicators
    - card_sprint_changed: move card between sprints in timeline
  4. Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s max)
  5. Show connection status indicator in top nav (green dot = connected, yellow = reconnecting, red = offline)

  Step 14: Optimize Performance
  1. Implement virtualization for long columns (>50 cards):
    - Use react-window or react-virtualized
    - Render visible cards + 5-item buffer above/below
  2. Code splitting by route:
    - Separate chunks for: /dashboard, /boards/[id], /boards/[id]/timeline, /settings
  3. Lazy load heavy components:
    - Card detail modal: React.lazy(() => import('./card-detail-modal'))
    - Command palette: load on first ⌘+K press
    - Timeline view: load on view switch
  4. Image optimization:
    - User avatars: use Next.js <Image> component with blur placeholder
    - Serve WebP format with PNG fallback
    - Size variants: 32px, 48px, 64px
  5. Debounce search inputs, filters, inline edits: 300ms
  6. React.memo expensive components: <Card>, <Column>, <SprintColumn>

  Phase 7: Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation

  Step 15: Implement Keyboard Shortcuts
  1. Create global keyboard listener in /app/layout.tsx:
    - ⌘+K / Ctrl+K: open command palette
    - J: focus next card, K: focus previous card
    - C: create card in focused column
    - E: edit focused card (open detail modal)
    - V: toggle views (Kanban ↔ Timeline)
    - Escape: close modals, clear selections
    - Tab: cycle through interactive elements
  2. Show focus indicators: 3px solid blue outline (#0366D6), 2px offset
  3. Disable shortcuts when typing in text inputs (check event.target.tagName)

  Step 16: Ensure WCAG AA Compliance
  1. Semantic HTML: use <button>, <nav>, <main>, <article> (NOT <div onclick>)
  2. ARIA labels for icon-only buttons: aria-label="Create card"
  3. ARIA live regions for toasts: role="status" or role="alert"
  4. Form labels explicitly associated: <label htmlFor="card-title">
  5. Color contrast verification:
    - Text: minimum 4.5:1 ratio
    - UI components: minimum 3:1 ratio
    - Test with tools: axe DevTools, WebAIM contrast checker
  6. Status conveyed with icons + color: PR status (green ✓ + text), not just color alone
  7. Keyboard navigation for drag-and-drop: Space to pick up, arrows to move, Space to drop

  API Client Setup (TanStack Query)

  // /lib/api-client.ts
  import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

  export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: {
        staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
        cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
        refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
        retry: 2,
      },
    },
  });

  // Example query hook
  export function useBoard(boardId: string) {
    return useQuery({
      queryKey: ['boards', boardId],
      queryFn: async () => {
        const res = await fetch(`/api/boards/${boardId}`, {
          headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${getAuthToken()}` },
        });
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch board');
        return res.json() as Promise<Board>;
      },
    });
  }

  // Example mutation hook with optimistic update
  export function useMoveCard() {
    const queryClient = useQueryClient();

    return useMutation({
      mutationFn: async ({ cardId, columnId, position }: MoveCardParams) => {
        const res = await fetch(`/api/cards/${cardId}`, {
          method: 'PATCH',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', Authorization: `Bearer ${getAuthToken()}` },
          body: JSON.stringify({ column_id: columnId, position }),
        });
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to move card');
        return res.json();
      },
      onMutate: async ({ cardId, columnId, position }) => {
        // Optimistic update: move card immediately in UI
        await queryClient.cancelQueries(['boards', boardId]);
        const prevBoard = queryClient.getQueryData(['boards', boardId]);
        // ... update board data with new card position
        return { prevBoard };
      },
      onError: (err, variables, context) => {
        // Rollback on failure
        queryClient.setQueryData(['boards', boardId], context.prevBoard);
        toast.error('Failed to move card. Please try again.');
      },
      onSuccess: () => {
        queryClient.invalidateQueries(['boards', boardId]);
      },
    });
  }

  Drag-and-Drop Implementation with @dnd-kit

  // /components/board/kanban-board.tsx
  import { DndContext, DragEndEvent, DragOverlay, MouseSensor, TouchSensor, useSensor, useSensors } from '@dnd-kit/core';
  import { SortableContext, horizontalListSortingStrategy } from '@dnd-kit/sortable';

  export function KanbanBoard({ board }: { board: Board }) {
    const moveCardMutation = useMoveCard();
    const sensors = useSensors(
      useSensor(MouseSensor, { activationConstraint: { distance: 5 } }),
      useSensor(TouchSensor, { activationConstraint: { delay: 500, tolerance: 5 } })
    );

    const handleDragEnd = (event: DragEndEvent) => {
      const { active, over } = event;
      if (!over || active.id === over.id) return;

      const cardId = active.id as string;
      const targetColumnId = over.id as string;
      const position = calculateNewPosition(over, board); // Custom logic

      moveCardMutation.mutate({ cardId, columnId: targetColumnId, position });
    };

    return (
      <DndContext sensors={sensors} onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}>
        <div className="flex gap-4 overflow-x-auto p-4">
          {board.columns.map((column) => (
            <Column key={column.id} column={column} cards={getCardsForColumn(column.id)} />
          ))}
        </div>
      </DndContext>
    );
  }

  Component Styling Example (Mobile-First Tailwind)

  // /components/board/card.tsx
  export function Card({ card }: { card: Card }) {
    return (
      <div className={cn(
        // Base mobile styles (default)
        "flex flex-col gap-2 p-3 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 bg-white",
        "hover:shadow-md hover:border-primary transition-all duration-150",
        // Tablet styles (768px+)
        "sm:p-4 sm:gap-3",
        // Desktop styles (1024px+)
        "md:min-h-[120px]",
        // Priority indicator (left border)
        card.priority === 'urgent' && "border-l-4 border-l-red-500",
        card.priority === 'high' && "border-l-4 border-l-orange-500",
        card.priority === 'medium' && "border-l-4 border-l-yellow-500",
        card.priority === 'low' && "border-l-4 border-l-blue-500"
      )}>
        {/* Card ID - mobile: 11px, desktop: 12px */}
        <span className="font-mono text-[11px] md:text-xs text-neutral-700">
          {card.id.slice(0, 8)}
        </span>

        {/* Title - mobile: 2 lines max */}
        <h3 className="text-sm md:text-base font-semibold line-clamp-2">
          {card.title}
        </h3>

        {/* Metadata row - stacks on mobile, row on desktop */}
        <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:items-center sm:justify-between gap-2">
          {/* Assignees - mobile: 2 avatars, desktop: 3 avatars */}
          <div className="flex -space-x-2">
            {card.assignees.slice(0, 3).map((user) => (
              <Avatar key={user.id} src={user.avatar_url} alt={user.username} size="sm" />
            ))}
            {card.assignees.length > 3 && (
              <span className="text-xs text-neutral-600">+{card.assignees.length - 3}</span>
            )}
          </div>

          {/* Story points badge */}
          {card.story_points && (
            <Badge variant="outline" className="text-xs">{card.story_points} pts</Badge>
          )}
        </div>

        {/* PR badge - only show on desktop to save space on mobile */}
        {card.linked_prs && card.linked_prs.length > 0 && (
          <div className="hidden sm:flex items-center gap-1">
            <Badge variant={getPRBadgeVariant(card.linked_prs[0].state)}>
              PR #{card.linked_prs[0].pr_number}
            </Badge>
            <CIStatusIcon status={card.linked_prs[0].ci_status.status} />
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }

  Constraints & What NOT to Do

  DO NOT:
  - Use Moment.js (too heavy, use date-fns instead)
  - Use CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or Emotion (use Tailwind only)
  - Use Pages Router (use App Router with RSC)
  - Create global CSS files beyond Tailwind directives (all styling via Tailwind utilities)
  - Use <div onclick> for interactive elements (use semantic <button>, <a>)
  - Rely on color alone for status (always pair with icons or text)
  - Hard-code API URLs (use environment variables: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL)
  - Store sensitive tokens in localStorage (use httpOnly cookies or secure session storage)
  - Use synchronous data fetching in App Router (leverage RSC and async/await)
  - Create components >300 lines (split into smaller, composable units)

  ALWAYS:
  - Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
  - Implement loading states (skeleton loaders, spinners within 100ms)
  - Show error boundaries (React error boundaries with user-friendly messages)
  - Debounce search and filter inputs (300ms)
  - Implement optimistic UI updates for mutations
  - Use React.memo for expensive components (Card, Column)
  - Add ARIA labels to icon-only buttons
  - Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape, arrows)
  - Verify color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text minimum)
  - Use Next.js <Image> component for all images (automatic optimization)
  - Implement proper error handling with try-catch and error toasts
  - Follow mobile-first CSS approach (base styles for mobile, sm:/md:/lg: for larger screens)

  DEFINE A STRICT SCOPE

  What This Prompt SHOULD Generate:

  1. Complete Next.js 14+ application structure using App Router with TypeScript
  2. Design system implementation with Tailwind config, shadcn/ui base components, and Taskly-specific customizations
  3. Primary screens:
    - Kanban Board View with drag-and-drop columns and cards
    - Card Detail Modal (three tabs: Details, Activity, Linked PRs)
    - Timeline View with horizontal sprint columns
    - Command Palette (⌘+K) with fuzzy search
    - Top Navigation shell with responsive breakpoints
  4. State management setup: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for client state, WebSocket integration for real-time updates
  5. Accessibility features: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus indicators, screen reader support
  6. Performance optimizations: Code splitting, lazy loading, virtualization for long lists, optimistic UI updates
  7. Responsive layouts: Mobile-first CSS with breakpoints at 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop), 1440px (wide)

  What This Prompt Should NOT Touch:

  1. Backend API implementation - Assume all endpoints exist and return properly typed data per the TypeScript interfaces provided
  2. Database schema or migrations - Frontend consumes API only, no direct DB access
  3. GitHub OAuth implementation - Assume authentication tokens are managed by backend, frontend receives JWT
  4. Webhook processing - Backend handles GitHub webhooks, frontend only receives WebSocket events for real-time updates
  5. Email notifications - Backend responsibility
  6. CI/CD configuration - Deployment pipelines managed separately
  7. Workspace settings, user management, team invitations - These admin screens are out of scope for initial generation; focus on
  core board/card experience
  8. Mobile native apps - Web responsive only, no React Native or native iOS/Android code

  FINAL NOTES & MOBILE-FIRST REMINDER

  Critical Mobile-First Approach:
  When writing CSS with Tailwind, ALWAYS start with base styles that assume a mobile viewport (<768px), then progressively enhance for
   larger screens using sm:, md:, lg: prefixes.

  Example:
  // ❌ WRONG - Desktop-first (anti-pattern)
  <div className="w-[320px] md:w-full">

  // ✅ CORRECT - Mobile-first (best practice)
  <div className="w-full md:w-[320px]">

  Mobile Design Priorities:
  1. Single-column layouts on mobile, expand to multi-column on tablet+
  2. Larger touch targets (min 44x44px) on mobile/tablet
  3. Simplified navigation (hamburger menu, bottom tab bar)
  4. Hide secondary metadata on mobile cards (show on detail modal only)
  5. Long-press (500ms) to activate drag mode on touch devices
  6. Horizontal swipe gestures for column navigation on mobile

  Performance is Critical:
  - Page load: <1s cached, <2s cold start
  - View transitions: <500ms (Kanban ↔ Timeline)
  - Command palette: <100ms open time
  - Drag operations: 60 FPS (16.67ms per frame)
  - All animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)

  All AI-Generated Code MUST Be Human-Reviewed:
  The code produced by this prompt will require careful human review, testing across browsers and devices, accessibility audits (axe
  DevTools), performance profiling (Lighthouse), and security review before being considered production-ready. This prompt provides a
  strong foundation, but manual refinement is essential for quality, maintainability, and adherence to team coding standards.

  Clearly states the overall objective: creating a production-ready Next.js frontend for Taskly with specific UX priorities
  (keyboard-first, real-time, speed) and compliance requirements (WCAG AA).

  ### **2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions** ✅
  Broken into 16 granular steps organized into 7 phases:
  - Phase 1: Foundation & Design System (Steps 1-3)
  - Phase 2: Navigation (Steps 4-5)
  - Phase 3: Kanban Board (Steps 6-9)
  - Phase 4: Card Detail Modal (Step 10)
  - Phase 5: Timeline View (Steps 11-12)
  - Phase 6: Real-Time & Performance (Steps 13-14)
  - Phase 7: Accessibility (Steps 15-16)

  Each step provides specific actions the AI should take, ensuring nothing is left to guesswork.

  ### **3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints** ✅
  Includes:
  - **TypeScript interfaces** for all core models (Card, Board, PullRequest, Sprint)
  - **API client setup** with TanStack Query (queries, mutations, optimistic updates)
  - **Drag-and-drop implementation** with @dnd-kit code
  - **Component styling example** showing mobile-first Tailwind approach
  - **Constraints section** with explicit DO NOTs and ALWAYS rules

  ### **4. Strict Scope Definition** ✅
  Explicitly defines:
  - **SHOULD generate:** 7 categories of files/features
  - **Should NOT touch:** 8 backend/infrastructure concerns
  - **Files to create/modify:** Complete file tree with paths

  🎯 COMPLETE AI UI GENERATION PROMPT FOR TASKLY KANBAN BOARD

  # PROJECT CONTEXT

  You are building the primary Kanban Board View for "Taskly" - a Git-native project management tool that synchronizes visual task
  boards with GitHub repositories. This board is the core daily workspace where developers manage tasks with real-time Git
  integration.

  ## Tech Stack
  - **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router with TypeScript)
  - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3+
  - **Component Library:** shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI primitives)
  - **Drag & Drop:** @dnd-kit/core (modern, accessible drag-and-drop)
  - **Icons:** Heroicons v2 (outline style) + GitHub Octicons (for Git-specific elements)

  ## Design Philosophy
  - **Developer-first, zero-friction UX:** Speed and keyboard shortcuts are paramount
  - **Information density with visual calm:** Show PR status, CI results, metadata inline without clutter
  - **GitHub-inspired aesthetics:** Clean, professional, technical sophistication (not consumer playful)
  - **Performance obsession:** All interactions must feel instant (<100ms response, 60 FPS animations)

  ---

  # HIGH-LEVEL GOAL

  Create a fully interactive, production-ready Kanban board component with drag-and-drop cards across customizable columns,
  comprehensive card metadata display (PR status, CI badges, assignees, priority), hover-activated quick actions, multi-select
  functionality, board header with filters/search, and real-time update indicators—all following the Taskly design system with
  mobile-first responsive patterns.

  ---

  # DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

  ## Phase 1: Project Setup & Dependencies

  1. Initialize a Next.js 14 TypeScript project with App Router if not already created
  2. Install required dependencies:
     - `@dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities` (drag-and-drop)
     - `@radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-checkbox @radix-ui/react-avatar @radix-ui/react-tooltip`
  (UI primitives)
     - `lucide-react` (icon library, Heroicons alternative)
     - `clsx tailwind-merge` (className utilities)
  3. Configure Tailwind CSS with the custom color palette defined below (see Design System section)
  4. Set up shadcn/ui by copying base components: Button, Input, Select, Dropdown Menu, Checkbox, Avatar, Tooltip, Badge

  ## Phase 2: Type Definitions & Data Structures

  5. Create a `types/board.ts` file with the following TypeScript interfaces:

  ```typescript
  export type Priority = 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  export type PRStatus = 'draft' | 'open' | 'approved' | 'merged' | 'closed';
  export type CIStatus = 'pending' | 'running' | 'passed' | 'failed';

  export interface User {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    avatarUrl: string;
    email: string;
  }

  export interface Label {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    color: string; // hex color
  }

  export interface PullRequest {
    id: string;
    number: number;
    title: string;
    url: string;
    status: PRStatus;
    ciStatus?: CIStatus;
    commitCount: number;
    createdAt: string;
  }

  export interface Card {
    id: string; // Format: CARD-123
    title: string;
    description?: string;
    columnId: string;
    assignees: User[];
    priority: Priority;
    labels: Label[];
    storyPoints?: number;
    dueDate?: string;
    commentCount: number;
    linkedPRs: PullRequest[];
    createdAt: string;
    updatedAt: string;
    position: number; // For ordering within column
  }

  export interface Column {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    position: number;
    cardIds: string[]; // Ordered array of card IDs
    color?: string; // Optional accent color
  }

  export interface Board {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    columns: Column[];
    cards: Record<string, Card>; // Card ID -> Card object map
  }

  6. Create sample mock data in lib/mock-data.ts with 3-4 columns (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done) and 8-12 cards with varied
  metadata to showcase all visual states

  Phase 3: Design System Configuration

  7. Update tailwind.config.ts with the Taskly color palette:

  colors: {
    primary: {
      DEFAULT: '#0366D6',
      hover: '#0256C2',
    },
    secondary: '#6E7681',
    accent: '#8B5CF6',
    success: '#2DA44E',
    warning: '#BF8700',
    error: '#CF222E',
    neutral: {
      50: '#F6F8FA',
      100: '#EAEEF2',
      200: '#D0D7DE',
      700: '#57606A',
      900: '#24292F',
    },
    priority: {
      low: '#0969DA',
      medium: '#D4A72C',
      high: '#FB8500',
      urgent: '#DA3633',
    },
  }

  8. Add custom spacing scale (8px base grid): 1 (4px), 2 (8px), 3 (12px), 4 (16px), 6 (24px), 8 (32px)
  9. Set default font to Inter with monospace fallback for card IDs: fontFamily: { sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui'], mono: ['Fira Code', 
  'monospace'] }

  Phase 4: Core Component Structure

  10. Create the main board component structure in app/board/page.tsx (or components/board/kanban-board.tsx):
    - Top-level container with fixed header + scrollable content area
    - Board header component (separate) with breadcrumbs, view toggle, filters, search
    - Columns container with horizontal scroll (flexbox with overflow-x-auto)
    - Each column is 320px wide with 16px gaps between columns
  11. Create components/board/board-header.tsx:
    - Left section: Board name (editable on click, but start as static text), star/favorite toggle button
    - Center section: View toggle buttons (Kanban selected | Timeline), active sprint indicator badge
    - Right section: Filter dropdowns (Assignee, Priority multi-selects), search input, board settings gear icon button
    - Make header sticky with sticky top-0 z-10 and backdrop blur
  12. Create components/board/board-column.tsx:
    - Column header: Title (editable inline on double-click, but start static), card count badge, "+" add card button
    - Droppable area for cards (using @dnd-kit's useDroppable hook)
    - Vertical card list with 12px spacing between cards
    - Apply min-height: 200px to allow dropping into empty columns
    - Column styling: bg-neutral-50 rounded-lg p-3 with border border-neutral-200

  Phase 5: Card Component (Critical - Most Complex)

  13. Create components/board/card.tsx with compact card layout (120px min height):
    - Card ID (top-left): Monospace font, 12px, secondary color, format "CARD-123"
    - Title (below ID): 14px semibold, 2-line truncate with ellipsis, primary text color
    - Priority Indicator (top-right): Colored dot (8px circle) with tooltip showing priority level
    - Assignee Avatars (bottom-left): Max 3 visible, 32px size, stacked with -8px overlap, "+2" badge if more
    - Metadata Row (bottom-center): Labels (max 2 visible badge pills), story points badge, comment count icon + number
    - PR Badge (bottom-right): GitHub icon + PR status color (draft: gray, open: blue, approved: green, merged: purple)
    - CI Status (adjacent to PR badge): Check/X icon with color (running: yellow spinner, passed: green check, failed: red X)
  14. Implement card states with Tailwind classes:
    - Default: bg-white border border-neutral-200 rounded-lg shadow-sm p-3
    - Hover: shadow-md border-primary transition-shadow duration-150 + show quick action buttons (edit, assign, delete icons as ghost
  buttons in top-right, fade in on hover)
    - Dragging: opacity-60 rotate-2 scale-105 (ghost effect)
    - Selected (multi-select): border-primary border-2 + checkbox visible in top-left
    - Overdue (if dueDate < today): border-error border-l-4 (left accent border)
  15. Make card draggable using @dnd-kit's useSortable hook:
    - Provide card ID as unique identifier
    - Apply cursor-grab on hover, cursor-grabbing while dragging
    - Use transform CSS for smooth drag animation
  16. Add quick actions toolbar (visible on hover):
    - Edit button (pencil icon): Opens card detail modal (placeholder click handler)
    - Assign button (user-plus icon): Opens assignee dropdown
    - Delete button (trash icon): Shows confirmation dialog
    - Position: absolute top-2 right-2 with fade-in animation

  Phase 6: Drag-and-Drop Implementation

  17. Set up @dnd-kit context in the main board component:
    - Wrap the board in <DndContext> with sensors (mouse, touch, keyboard)
    - Use closestCorners collision detection algorithm
    - Implement onDragStart, onDragOver, onDragEnd handlers
  18. In onDragStart:
    - Store dragged card ID in state
    - Add visual feedback (dim non-target columns)
  19. In onDragOver:
    - Calculate hover position and show drop indicator line between cards
    - Update temporary card position for smooth reordering preview
  20. In onDragEnd:
    - Update board state (move card to new column and position)
    - Clear dragging state
    - Show success toast notification: "Card moved to [Column Name]"
    - Simulate optimistic update (no API call needed for mock)
  21. Configure drop zones in each column using useDroppable:
    - Allow dropping only if column accepts cards
    - Highlight drop zone with blue border when dragging over: border-primary border-2 border-dashed

  Phase 7: Multi-Select Functionality

  22. Add multi-select state management:
    - Track selected card IDs in array state: const [selectedCards, setSelectedCards] = useState<string[]>([])
    - Shift+click on card adds to selection
    - Checkbox appears on hover OR when any cards are selected (show checkboxes on all cards)
  23. When cards are selected, show floating action bar at bottom of screen:
    - Display: "X cards selected" text
    - Bulk action buttons: Assign, Add Label, Change Priority, Move to Column, Delete
    - Clear selection button (X icon)
    - Styling: fixed bottom-4 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 bg-neutral-900 text-white rounded-full px-6 py-3 shadow-lg
  24. Implement bulk operations:
    - Each button opens a dropdown/modal to select new value
    - On confirm, apply change to all selected cards
    - Show toast: "Updated X cards"

  Phase 8: Filters & Search (Board Header Interactivity)

  25. Implement search input in board header:
    - Controlled input with debounce (300ms) to avoid excessive re-renders
    - Filter cards by title match (case-insensitive)
    - Highlight matching text in card titles (optional enhancement)
    - Show "No cards found" empty state if search returns zero results
  26. Implement filter dropdowns:
    - Assignee filter: Multi-select dropdown showing all users, filter cards where assignee is in selected list
    - Priority filter: Multi-select with Low/Medium/High/Urgent options
    - Active filters show badge count on filter button: "Assignee (2)"
    - "Clear all filters" button appears when filters are active
  27. Combine filters with AND logic:
    - Card must match ALL active filters to be visible
    - Apply filters to card list before rendering columns

  Phase 9: Responsive & Polish

  28. Implement responsive breakpoints:
    - Mobile (<768px): Single column view with horizontal swipe tabs to switch columns, show "Best viewed on desktop" banner
    - Tablet (768-1023px): 2 columns visible, horizontal scroll, 280px column width
    - Desktop (1024px+): Standard 320px columns, show all columns with horizontal scroll if needed
  29. Add loading states:
    - Skeleton loaders for cards while data fetches: gray animated pulse rectangles
    - Spinner in board header during initial load
  30. Add empty states:
    - Empty column: Show dashed border drop zone with "+ Add your first card" text and icon
    - No boards: Centered illustration with "Create your first board" CTA
  31. Implement smooth animations:
    - Card drag: Use @dnd-kit's built-in smooth animations (spring physics)
    - Hover: transition-all duration-150 ease-out
    - Modal/dropdown open: Fade + scale from 0.95 to 1.0 in 200ms
    - Toast notifications: Slide in from top-right in 200ms

  Phase 10: Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation

  32. Ensure WCAG AA compliance:
    - All interactive elements have visible focus rings: focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:ring-offset-2
    - Color contrast ratios verified (primary button 6.1:1, body text 14.2:1)
    - All icon-only buttons have aria-labels
  33. Implement keyboard navigation:
    - Tab through cards in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
    - J/K keys to navigate cards (focus previous/next)
    - Space to pick up card, arrow keys to move, Space to drop (via @dnd-kit keyboard sensor)
    - Enter to open card detail
    - C to create new card (when no input focused)
  34. Add screen reader support:
    - Semantic HTML: <button>, <nav>, <main> (not divs with onClick)
    - ARIA labels for all actions: "Move card to In Progress", "Assign to Alice"
    - Live region for toast notifications: role="status" aria-live="polite"

  API Contract (Mock - No Backend Required Yet)

  Board State Shape:
  {
    board: {
      id: "board-1",
      name: "Web App Development",
      columns: [
        { id: "col-1", title: "To Do", position: 0, cardIds: ["CARD-1", "CARD-2"] },
        { id: "col-2", title: "In Progress", position: 1, cardIds: ["CARD-3"] },

        // ... more cards
      }
    }
  }

  Design Constraints - DO NOT DEVIATE

  - Column Width: MUST be exactly 320px on desktop, 280px on tablet
  - Card Spacing: MUST use 12px vertical gaps between cards
  - Color Palette: ONLY use the colors defined in the Tailwind config above (no arbitrary hex values)
  - Font Sizes: Body text 14px, headings 16-24px, small text 12px (no other sizes)
  - Card ID Format: MUST be monospace font, uppercase, format "CARD-###"
  - PR Badge: MUST use GitHub Octicons (or Lucide git-pull-request icon as fallback)
  - Animations: ALL animations MUST use transform/opacity (GPU-accelerated), NOT width/height/top/left
  - Touch Targets: Minimum 40px height for buttons on desktop, 44px on mobile/tablet
  - Icons: Use Lucide React icons exclusively (Heroicons alternative), 20px default size, 16px for inline

  DO NOT Include These Features (Out of Scope)

  - ❌ Backend API integration (use mock data in lib/mock-data.ts)
  - ❌ Authentication/login (assume user is logged in)
  - ❌ Card detail modal content (just show alert on click for now)
  - ❌ Real-time WebSocket updates (simulate with mock)
  - ❌ Timeline view (separate component, not in this scope)
  - ❌ Command palette (separate feature)
  - ❌ Branch creation / GitHub integration (UI placeholders only)
  - ❌ Dark mode toggle (implement light mode only, dark mode is future phase)
  - ❌ Mobile swipe gestures (show simplified mobile layout only)

  STRICT SCOPE DEFINITION

  What You SHOULD Create (In Scope)

  ✅ Files to Create:
  1. app/board/page.tsx - Main board page component
  2. components/board/kanban-board.tsx - Board container with DndContext
  3. components/board/board-header.tsx - Header with filters, search, view toggle
  4. components/board/board-column.tsx - Single column with droppable area
  5. components/board/card.tsx - Individual card component with all metadata
  6. components/board/bulk-action-bar.tsx - Floating action bar for multi-select
  7. components/ui/* - shadcn/ui base components (Button, Select, Input, etc.)
  8. lib/mock-data.ts - Sample board data with 3-4 columns and 8-12 cards
  9. types/board.ts - TypeScript interfaces for Card, Column, Board, etc.
  10. tailwind.config.ts - Custom Taskly color palette and spacing

  ✅ Functionality to Implement:
  - Full drag-and-drop with @dnd-kit (cards between columns, reordering within columns)
  - Hover states with quick action buttons (edit, assign, delete icons)
  - Multi-select with shift-click + bulk action bar
  - Search with debounce (filters cards by title)
  - Filter dropdowns (assignee, priority multi-selects)
  - Responsive layout (mobile: simplified, tablet: 2 columns, desktop: all columns)
  - Keyboard navigation (Tab, J/K, Space, Enter)
  - Toast notifications for actions (optimistic UI feedback)
  - Empty states (empty column, no search results)
  - Loading skeleton states
  - Accessibility (focus rings, ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

  What You MUST NOT Modify (Out of Scope)

  ❌ Do NOT create or modify:
  - Any authentication-related files (auth.ts, login pages)
  - API route handlers (app/api/*)
  - Database schemas or Prisma models
  - Environment configuration files
  - Deployment configuration (Vercel, Docker, etc.)
  - Testing files (Jest, Playwright) - these come later
  - Documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING)

  ❌ Do NOT implement:
  - Actual API calls (use mock data only)
  - WebSocket connections for real-time updates
  - GitHub API integration
  - User profile management
  - Settings pages
  - Analytics/tracking
  - Error boundary components (unless specifically for board errors)

  ---
  VISUAL STYLE GUIDANCE

  Reference Inspiration (Design Aesthetic)

  - GitHub Projects: Monospace fonts for IDs, subdued color palette, professional tone
  - Linear: Fast animations (200-300ms), keyboard-first UI, generous whitespace
  - Trello: Familiar Kanban layout, drag-and-drop fluidity, column-based organization
  - Avoid: Consumer-playful aesthetics (bright colors, rounded bubbly shapes, emoji overuse)

  Mobile-First Responsive Pattern

  Mobile Portrait (<768px):
  - Single column view with tab selector at top to switch between columns
  - Full-width cards (no drag-and-drop, tap to select)
  - Simplified header: hamburger menu, search only, filters in drawer
  - Show persistent banner: "Best viewed on desktop for full experience"
  - Minimum touch targets: 44x44px

  Tablet (768-1023px):
  - 2 columns visible side-by-side with horizontal scroll
  - Condensed column width: 280px
  - Header shows view toggle + search, filters in overflow menu
  - Touch-optimized: long-press (500ms) to activate drag

  Desktop (1024px+):
  - Standard 320px columns, all visible with horizontal scroll
  - Full header with all controls visible
  - Mouse hover interactions fully enabled
  - Keyboard shortcuts active

  Color Usage Guidelines

  - Primary Blue (#0366D6): CTAs, focus rings, active states, links
  - Success Green (#2DA44E): Passed CI, merged PRs, success toasts
  - Warning Yellow (#BF8700): Pending CI, overdue warnings
  - Error Red (#CF222E): Failed CI, destructive actions, validation errors
  - Priority Colors: Low (blue), Medium (yellow), High (orange), Urgent (red)
  - Neutral Grays: Backgrounds (50), borders (200), secondary text (700), primary text (900)

  ---
  FINAL REMINDERS & IMPORTANT NOTES

  Code Quality Standards

  1. TypeScript: Use strict typing, no any types (use unknown if truly dynamic)
  2. Component Structure: Small, single-responsibility components (<200 lines)
  3. Props: Explicit prop interfaces, destructure in function signature
  4. State Management: Start with React useState, no external state library needed yet
  5. Performance: Use React.memo for Card component (re-renders on every drag), useMemo for filtered card lists
  6. Naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

  Accessibility Checklist

  - All buttons have aria-labels or visible text
  - Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements (3px blue ring)
  - Keyboard navigation tested (Tab, Space, Enter, Arrow keys)
  - Color not the only indicator of status (always include text/icon)
  - Semantic HTML used (<button> not <div onClick>)
  - ARIA live region for toast notifications

  Testing Your Implementation

  Manual Test Checklist:
  1. Drag card from To Do to In Progress (should animate smoothly)
  2. Hover over card (quick actions should fade in)
  3. Shift+click 3 cards (bulk action bar should appear at bottom)
  4. Type in search box (should filter cards after 300ms debounce)
  5. Click assignee filter, select 2 users (cards should filter immediately)
  6. Tab through board with keyboard (focus ring should be visible)
  7. Press J/K (focus should move to previous/next card)
  8. Resize browser to tablet width (should show 2 columns)
  9. Resize to mobile (<768px) (should show single column + tab selector)
  10. Check empty column (should show "+ Add card" placeholder)

  Post-Generation Next Steps

  After the AI generates this component, you MUST:

  1. Human Code Review: Review all generated code for security issues, type safety, performance anti-patterns
  2. Accessibility Audit: Run axe DevTools extension, verify 0 violations
  3. Browser Testing: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari (ensure drag-and-drop works in all)
  4. Mobile Testing: Test on real iOS/Android device or simulator (touch interactions)
  5. Refinement: The AI-generated code is a foundation, NOT production-ready. Expect to iterate on edge cases, error handling, and
  polish.

  Known Limitations of AI-Generated Code:
  - May have subtle bugs in drag-and-drop edge cases (dragging to empty column, rapid drags)
  - Accessibility may need manual verification (screen reader testing)
  - Performance may need optimization (virtualization for 100+ cards)
  - Error states may be incomplete (network failures, invalid data)

  📋 What I Created For You

  I've generated a comprehensive, production-ready AI prompt for Lovable/V0 following the structured 4-part framework:

  1. High-Level Goal

  Clear objective: Build a fully interactive Kanban board with drag-and-drop, filters, multi-select, and all the features from your
  spec.

  2. Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions (34 Steps!)

  Broken into 10 phases:
  - Project setup & dependencies
  - Type definitions & data structures
  - Design system configuration (your custom Tailwind colors)
  - Core component structure
  - Card component (most complex, with all metadata)
  - Drag-and-drop implementation (@dnd-kit)
  - Multi-select functionality
  - Filters & search
  - Responsive design
  - Accessibility & keyboard navigation

  3. Code Examples & Constraints

  - Complete TypeScript interfaces for Card, Column, Board, User, PR, etc.
  - Sample Card component implementation
  - Mock data structure
  - Strict design constraints (320px columns, 12px spacing, specific colors)
  - Clear DO NOT list (no dark mode, no backend, no Timeline view, etc.)

  4. Strict Scope Definition

  - ✅ 10 files to create (explicitly listed)
  - ✅ Functionality to implement (drag-and-drop, filters, responsive, a11y)
  - ❌ What NOT to modify (auth, API routes, database)
  - ❌ What NOT to implement (backend, WebSockets, GitHub API)

  📝 Important Reminders

  ⚠️ CRITICAL: All AI-generated code will require careful human review, testing, and refinement to be considered production-ready.

  After you get the generated code:

  1. Review for security issues (XSS vulnerabilities in card rendering)
  2. Test accessibility (run axe DevTools, keyboard navigation)
  3. Test drag-and-drop edge cases (empty columns, rapid drags)
  4. Verify responsive design (test on actual mobile devices)
  5. Optimize performance (React.memo, virtualization for 100+ cards)

  ---
  🚀 Next Steps

  1. Copy the entire prompt (inside the large code block above)
  2. Paste into Lovable.dev or Vercel V0
  3. Wait for generation (may take 2-5 minutes for complex prompts)
  4. Download the generated code
  5. Test locally using the manual test checklist I provided
  6. Iterate and refine based on your specific needs

  ---
  💡 Pro Tips

  - If the AI output is incomplete: Use the step numbers to tell it which phase to continue from (e.g., "Continue from Phase 7:
  Multi-Select")
  - If something doesn't match: Reference the specific constraint (e.g., "Column width MUST be 320px per the design constraints")
  - If you want variations: Modify the sample data in lib/mock-data.ts section to show different UI states

  🎓 How To Use

  For Each Component:

  1. Open the prompt file (e.g., kanban-board-lovable-prompt.md)
  2. Copy everything between "🚀 PROMPT START" and "🚀 PROMPT END"
  3. Paste into Lovable.dev or Vercel V0
  4. Wait for generation (10-45 minutes depending on complexity)
  5. Download the generated code
  6. Test using the checklist in the prompt
  7. Refine based on your findings

  Start With This:

  # Open the master guide first
  open prompts/README.md

  # Then start with the easiest component
  open prompts/workspace-dashboard-lovable-prompt.md

  ⚠️ Important Reminders

  AI-Generated Code is NOT Production-Ready

  - Requires human review for security, performance, edge cases
  - TypeScript types may need refinement
  - Accessibility needs manual verification
  - Error handling may be incomplete

  What You Still Need To Build

  - ❌ Backend API (all prompts use mock data)
  - ❌ Authentication layer (prompts assume logged-in user)
  - ❌ Real-time WebSocket connections (currently simulated)
  - ❌ Database integration
  - ❌ GitHub API integration (branch creation, PR linking)

  Budget Additional Time

  - Generation: 2-3 hours
  - Testing: 3-4 hours
  - Refinement: 4-6 hours
  - Integration: 6-8 hours
  - Total: 15-21 hours for complete UI implementation
