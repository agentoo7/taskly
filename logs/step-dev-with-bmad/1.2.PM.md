  Section 1: Goals and Background Context

  I've reviewed your Project Brief. Let me draft the Goals, Background Context, and Change Log sections.

  Goals

  - Eliminate wasted developer time by synchronizing visual task boards with Git repositories
  - Preserve task-to-code context automatically to prevent reviewer context loss and costly rework cycles
  - Provide Trello-simple visual management with automated Git workflow capabilities
  - Enable real-time bidirectional sync where board actions trigger Git operations and code activity updates cards
  - Deliver multi-view project intelligence (Kanban, Timeline) for both developers and engineering managers
  - Establish Taskly as the Git-native project management solution ("Move a Card, Ship the Code")

  Background Context

  Software development teams today operate in fragmented workflows where task management (Trello, Jira, Linear) exists separately from
   code development (GitHub, GitLab). This fragmentation creates a "double-entry tax" where developers manually update both the
  project board and Git repositories, wasting 5-10 hours per week per developer. More critically, when reviewers open pull requests,
  they lack immediate access to original requirements, acceptance criteria, and design decisions‚Äîleading to context loss that causes
  misaligned code and preventable rework cycles.

  Taskly solves this by treating the project board as a "control surface for your repo"‚Äîwhere moving a card automatically triggers Git
   operations (branch creation, PR setup) and code activity (commits, CI runs, merges) updates card status in real-time. By
  maintaining bidirectional synchronization between tasks and code, Taskly ensures every PR is linked to its requirement, eliminates
  manual status updates, and preserves complete task-to-code traceability. The target market is software development teams (5-50
  developers) using GitHub alongside traditional project management tools who struggle with context switching and synchronization
  overhead.

  Change Log

  | Date       | Version | Description                                  | Author   |
  |------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
  | 2025-10-22 | 1.0     | Initial PRD draft created from Project Brief | PM Agent |

  Rationale:
  - Goals are derived directly from the brief's executive summary and value proposition, focusing on outcomes rather than features
  - Background Context synthesizes the problem statement and proposed solution in 2 concise paragraphs, avoiding redundancy with goals
  - The Brief already provided excellent framing of the "why" (context loss ‚Üí rework) and "what" (Git-native sync), which I've
  preserved
  - Change log initialized with this document's creation

  Section 2: Requirements

  Let me draft the Functional and Non-Functional Requirements based on the MVP scope in your brief.

‚è∫ Read(.bmad-core/data/elicitation-methods.md)
  ‚éø  Read 157 lines

‚è∫ Functional Requirements

  FR1: The system shall provide a Kanban board with drag-and-drop card management across customizable columns (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done).

  FR2: Each card shall support comprehensive metadata including title, description (markdown), acceptance criteria (markdown),
  assignees (one or multiple), priority (Low/Medium/High/Urgent), labels/tags, story points, sprint assignment, due dates, comments,
  and activity timeline.

  FR3: The system shall connect to GitHub organizations and repositories via OAuth 2.0 authentication.

  FR4: Each card shall support linking to one or more GitHub issues or pull requests via manual URL entry or auto-detection when
  branch/PR references the card ID.

  FR5: Cards linked to PRs shall display PR status (draft/ready/approved/merged), associated commits, and CI status inline within the
  card interface.

  FR6: When a user moves a card to "In Progress," the system shall offer one-click branch creation with configurable naming
  conventions (e.g., feature/TASK-123-brief-description).

  FR7: When a linked PR's state changes in GitHub (status updates, approvals, CI results), the system shall automatically update the
  corresponding card status within 1 second.

  FR8: When a linked PR is merged in GitHub, the system shall optionally auto-move the corresponding card to "Done" based on user
  preference.

  FR9: The system shall provide a Timeline view displaying sprints/iterations horizontally with cards grouped by sprint and story
  point totals visible.

  FR10: Users shall be able to drag cards between sprints in Timeline view to rebalance workload.

  FR11: The Timeline view shall display visual capacity indicators showing overloaded vs. balanced sprint allocation.

  FR12: The system shall provide a keyboard-first command palette (‚åò+K or Ctrl+K) enabling quick actions including create card,
  search, assign, change status, and navigate views.

  FR13: The system shall support keyboard navigation shortcuts including J/K for card navigation, C for create card, and E for edit
  card.

  FR14: Users shall be able to create workspaces and invite team members via email invitation.

  FR15: The system shall support basic role permissions with two levels: admin (full access) and member (standard access).

  FR16: Each workspace shall support multiple boards for organizing different projects or workflows.

  FR17: Users shall be able to multi-select cards using shift-click or checkbox selection.

  FR18: The system shall support batch operations on selected cards including assign multiple assignees, add labels, change priority,
  and move to column.

  Non-Functional Requirements

  NFR1: Page load time shall be less than 1 second for cached loads and less than 2 seconds for cold starts.

  NFR2: View transitions between Kanban, Timeline, and other views shall complete in less than 500 milliseconds.

  NFR4: Real-time updates triggered by webhooks shall reflect in the user interface within 1 second of the webhook event.

  NFR5: The system shall support 100+ concurrent users per workspace without performance degradation.

  NFR6: The application shall support modern browsers only: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+ (no IE11 support).

  NFR7: The user interface shall be desktop-first with responsive design supporting tablet devices.

  NFR8: All communications shall use HTTPS with TLS 1.3 encryption.

  NFR9: Authentication shall use JWT tokens with 15-minute access token expiration and 7-day refresh token expiration.

  NFR10: The API shall implement rate limiting on both per-user and per-IP basis to prevent abuse.

  NFR11: The system shall comply with GDPR requirements including user data export and right to deletion capabilities.

  NFR12: GitHub API rate limits (5000 requests/hour per authenticated user) shall be managed through aggressive caching and
  webhook-based updates instead of polling.

  Detailed Rationale:

  Trade-offs Made:
  - Scope vs. MVP Speed: I included all MVP features from the brief but kept each requirement atomic and testable. Some "nice-to-have"
   features like Calendar view, automated PR creation, and deep CI/CD integration were intentionally excluded as they're marked
  post-MVP in the brief.
  - Specificity vs. Flexibility: Requirements specify exact thresholds (e.g., <3 seconds for Git ops, <500ms view transitions) based
  on the brief's performance requirements, which provides clear targets but may need adjustment during technical implementation.
  - GitHub-Only: FR3 mentions only GitHub, not GitLab, aligning with the brief's MVP constraint to launch GitHub-first.

  Key Assumptions:
  - OAuth 2.0 is sufficient for MVP; more advanced GitHub App installation can come later
  - "Auto-detection" in FR4 assumes cards will have unique IDs that can be referenced in branch names or PR descriptions
  - One-click branch creation (FR6) is simpler than full automated PR creation with templates (deferred to Phase 2)
  - Real-time sync (NFR4) assumes WebSocket implementation, which the brief's tech stack supports

  Interesting Decisions:
  - FR8 (optional auto-move) makes merge-to-done configurable rather than forced, respecting that some teams may have additional steps
   post-merge
  - NFR12 explicitly calls out GitHub API rate limit management as a non-functional requirement because it's a critical constraint
  mentioned multiple times in the brief
  - Requirements avoid specifying implementation details (e.g., "WebSocket," "Celery") and focus on "what" not "how," leaving
  technical decisions to the Architect

  Areas Needing Validation:
  - Are the performance thresholds (NFR1-4) realistic? They're from the brief but haven't been validated by technical POC yet
  - Should FR4 support bulk linking (link 10 cards to 10 PRs at once), or is individual linking sufficient for MVP?
  - Does FR18 need to specify which batch operations are priorities, or are all equally important?

  Section 3: User Interface Design Goals

  Let me pre-fill the UI/UX vision based on the project brief and present it for your review.

  Overall UX Vision

  Taskly embraces a "developer-first, zero-friction" UX philosophy that prioritizes speed, clarity, and keyboard-driven workflows. The
   interface should feel as fast and responsive as a native desktop application while maintaining the visual simplicity that made
  Trello beloved. Every interaction‚Äîdragging cards, switching views, opening modals‚Äîmust complete in under 500ms with optimistic UI
  updates to eliminate perceived lag. The design balances information density (showing PR status, CI indicators, metadata inline) with
   visual breathing room, ensuring developers can scan boards quickly without cognitive overload. Dark mode support is essential given
   the developer audience.

  Key Interaction Paradigms

  1. Keyboard-First Navigation: Power users should rarely need a mouse. ‚åò+K command palette for all major actions, J/K for card
  navigation, arrow keys for moving focus, Enter to open, Escape to close.
  2. Drag-and-Drop as Primary Manipulation: Cards move between columns via drag-and-drop (with keyboard alternatives). Multi-select
  with Shift+Click or lasso selection enables batch operations.
  3. Contextual Inline Actions: Hover states reveal quick actions (assign, label, link PR) without opening modals. Only complex
  operations (edit full description, configure settings) require modal dialogs.
  4. Real-Time Collaboration Indicators: Subtle presence indicators show who's viewing/editing cards. Changes from other users appear
  instantly with brief animation to draw attention without disrupting focus.
  5. Progressive Disclosure: Cards show summary view by default (title, assignee, priority, PR status). Click to expand inline for
  full description, comments, and activity timeline. This keeps the board scannable while providing depth on demand.

  Core Screens and Views

  From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

  1. Kanban Board View - Primary daily workspace for managing task flow
  2. Timeline View (Sprint Planning) - Horizontal timeline for workload balancing and sprint management
  3. Card Detail Modal/Panel - Expanded view showing full description, acceptance criteria, comments, linked PRs/commits, activity
  timeline
  4. Workspace Dashboard - Landing page after login showing all boards in workspace with quick access
  5. Board Settings - Configure columns, naming conventions for branches, GitHub repo connections, automation rules
  6. Workspace Settings - Manage team members, permissions, integrations (GitHub OAuth)
  7. Onboarding Flow - Multi-step wizard: Create workspace ‚Üí Connect GitHub ‚Üí Create first board ‚Üí Link first card to PR
  8. Command Palette (‚åò+K) - Global search and action interface overlaying any screen

  Accessibility: WCAG AA

  Target WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance to ensure usability for developers with visual, motor, or cognitive disabilities. Specific
  requirements:
  - Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
  - Screen reader compatibility with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
  - Minimum 4.5:1 color contrast ratios for text
  - Focus indicators clearly visible on all interactive elements
  - No reliance on color alone to convey information (use icons + color for status)

  Assumption: Full WCAG AAA is deferred to post-MVP to balance compliance with development speed, but AA is achievable and aligns with
   developer tool best practices.

  Branding

  Visual Style: Clean, modern, professional aesthetic inspired by developer tools (GitHub, Linear, Vercel dashboards) rather than
  consumer productivity apps. Emphasis on typography hierarchy, generous whitespace, and functional design over decorative elements.

  Color Palette:
  - Primary: GitHub-inspired deep blue (#0366D6) for CTAs and active states
  - Neutral grays for backgrounds and text (light mode: #F6F8FA background, dark mode: #0D1117 background)
  - Status colors: Green (success/merged), Yellow (in progress/pending), Red (failed/blocked), Purple (in review)
  - All colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements

  Typography: Monospace font (Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, or SF Mono) for code references, card IDs, and branch names. Sans-serif
  (Inter, system-ui) for body text and UI elements.

  Iconography: Minimal, line-based icons (Heroicons or Lucide) with 2px stroke weight. GitHub's Octicons for Git-specific indicators
  (branch, PR, commit).

  Assumption: No existing brand guidelines; this proposes a "developer-native" aesthetic. If you have specific brand assets or color 
  schemes, we should incorporate them.

  Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

  Primary: Desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge 90+) optimized for screen sizes 1280x720 and above. Layout assumes
  horizontal space for multi-column Kanban boards and Timeline views.

  Secondary: Tablet devices (iPad, Android tablets) in landscape orientation with touch-optimized drag-and-drop. Portrait orientation
  shows single-column mobile-friendly layout with reduced feature set.

  Out of Scope for MVP: Native mobile apps (iOS/Android), though the responsive web app should be usable on mobile browsers for quick
  status checks or comment replies.

  Target OS: Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) via web browsers‚Äîno OS-specific features or native desktop wrappers.

  ---
  Rationale & Assumptions:

  Where I Made Assumptions:
  - Accessibility Level (WCAG AA): The brief mentions "developer-focused" but doesn't specify accessibility requirements. I chose AA
  as a reasonable balance between compliance and MVP speed.
  - Branding Details: The brief doesn't provide color schemes or visual references. I proposed a "GitHub-inspired" aesthetic based on
  the Git-native positioning and developer audience.
  - Dark Mode: Not explicitly mentioned in brief but assumed essential for developer tools.
  - Real-Time Collaboration Indicators: Brief mentions WebSocket real-time updates but doesn't specify presence indicators‚ÄîI included
  them as standard for modern collaborative tools.

  Trade-offs:
  - Desktop-First: Aligns with brief's "web-first" constraint and assumption that developers work primarily on desktops. Mobile
  deferred to preserve development speed.
  - Progressive Disclosure: Balances information density (showing PR status, CI indicators) with visual simplicity (Trello-like).
  Developers need rich data but hate clutter.
  - WCAG AA vs. AAA: AA is achievable for MVP without sacrificing performance targets; AAA would require additional design
  constraints.

  Questions for Clarification:
  1. Do you have existing brand assets (logo, color palette, typography) to incorporate?
  2. Should dark mode be available from day 1, or can we launch with light mode only and add dark mode in Phase 2?
  3. Are there specific developer tools whose UX you want to emulate (Linear's speed, Notion's flexibility, GitHub's familiarity)?

  Section 4: Technical Assumptions

  Let me check for existing technical preferences and then draft this section.

‚è∫ Read(.bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.md)
  ‚éø  Read 6 lines

‚è∫ Repository Structure: Monorepo

  Decision: Single repository containing both frontend (/frontend) and backend (/backend) directories.

  Rationale:
  - Enables atomic commits spanning both frontend and backend changes during rapid MVP development
  - Simplifies CI/CD pipeline setup with single GitHub Actions workflow
  - Easier coordination for small team (1-3 developers) without overhead of managing separate repos
  - Reduces context switching between repositories during feature development
  - Can split into polyrepo later if teams grow and need independent deployment cadence

  Tooling: Use Turborepo or Nx for monorepo management (build caching, task orchestration) or keep simple with npm workspaces for MVP.

  Service Architecture

  Architecture Pattern: Monolithic API (Single FastAPI Application) with Separate Job Queue

  Backend Service:
  - Single FastAPI application handling all REST endpoints and WebSocket connections
  - Simpler to develop, debug, and deploy for MVP scale (<10k users)
  - Scale vertically first (larger containers, more CPU/RAM) before considering microservices
  - Avoid premature microservices complexity; monolith is appropriate until proven bottlenecks emerge

  Job Queue Architecture:
  - Separate Celery worker processes for long-running asynchronous tasks:
    - Git operations (branch creation, webhook processing)
    - Bulk actions (batch card updates, report generation)
    - Email notifications and background processing
  - Redis as message broker and result backend
  - Enables non-blocking API responses for Git operations while maintaining <3s user-facing latency

  WebSocket Service:
  - Integrated within FastAPI application for real-time board updates
  - Maintains persistent connections for live collaboration and instant card sync
  - Falls back to polling if WebSocket connection fails (graceful degradation)

  Deployment Pattern: Docker Compose orchestrating multiple containers (Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery worker) with
  single docker-compose.yml for development and production.

  Testing Requirements

  Testing Strategy: Unit + Integration (Partial E2E Coverage)

  Unit Testing:
  - Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests, aim for 70%+ coverage on business logic
  - Backend: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async FastAPI endpoints, aim for 80%+ coverage on API routes and business logic
  - Focus on critical paths: Git integration, card CRUD operations, webhook handlers

  Integration Testing:
  - API integration tests using TestClient (FastAPI) to validate full request/response cycles
  - Database integration tests with test database (PostgreSQL) to verify ORM queries and transactions
  - GitHub API integration tests using mocked responses (vcr.py or responses library) to avoid rate limits

  E2E Testing (Limited Scope for MVP):
  - Playwright or Cypress for critical user flows only:
    - Onboarding: Signup ‚Üí Connect GitHub ‚Üí Create board ‚Üí Link first card
    - Core workflow: Create card ‚Üí Move to In Progress ‚Üí Link PR ‚Üí PR merge ‚Üí Card auto-moves to Done
  - Avoid comprehensive E2E coverage in MVP to maintain development velocity

  Manual Testing Conveniences:
  - Seed scripts for generating test workspaces, boards, and cards with realistic data
  - Development mode with hot reload (Next.js Fast Refresh, FastAPI --reload)
  - Docker Compose setup with easy reset (drop database, reseed) for clean testing environments

  CI/CD Testing Pipeline:
  - GitHub Actions workflow running on every PR:
    - Lint (ESLint, Ruff/Black for Python)
    - Type checking (TypeScript, mypy for Python)
    - Unit tests (frontend + backend)
    - Integration tests
    - Build verification (Docker image builds successfully)
  - Block merges if tests fail or coverage drops below thresholds

  Rationale:
  - Full testing pyramid (unit, integration, E2E) is ideal but E2E is time-intensive; focus on unit/integration for MVP speed
  - Manual testing conveniences reduce friction for rapid iteration during development
  - CI/CD ensures baseline quality without dedicated QA resources

  - Schema Design Principles:
    - Core tables: workspaces, boards, cards, users, teams, git_repositories, pull_requests (cached GitHub data)
    - Many-to-many relationships: cards ‚Üî pull_requests (card can link multiple PRs), users ‚Üî workspaces
    - JSONB columns for flexible metadata (card labels, custom fields) without schema migrations
    - Indexes: B-tree on foreign keys, GIN indexes on JSONB for fast filtering

  Infrastructure & Hosting:
  - Containerization: Docker with multi-stage builds (optimized image sizes)
  - Local Development: Docker Compose orchestrating all services (hot reload enabled)
  - Production Hosting: Cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean)
    - Compute: ECS (AWS), Cloud Run (GCP), or Droplets (DigitalOcean) running Docker containers
    - Database: Managed PostgreSQL (RDS, Cloud SQL, or DigitalOcean Managed Database)
    - Cache: Managed Redis (ElastiCache, Memorystore, or DigitalOcean Managed Redis)
    - Load Balancer: ALB (AWS) or cloud-native load balancer
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing, Docker image building, deployment to staging/production
  - Secrets Management: Environment variables via Docker secrets or cloud provider secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret
  Manager)

  Monitoring & Observability:
  - Error Tracking: Sentry for exception monitoring and alerting
  - Logging: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs for distributed tracing
  - Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana or Datadog for application metrics (API latency, queue depth, Git operation success rates)
  - Uptime Monitoring: UptimeRobot or Pingdom for external health checks

  Security:
  - HTTPS Everywhere: TLS 1.3 for all communications
  - Authentication: GitHub OAuth (no password management), JWT with short expiration (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
  - Authorization: Workspace-level RBAC (admin, member roles)
  - API Security: Rate limiting (per-user, per-IP), CORS configuration, input validation (Pydantic models)
  - Data Encryption: Encryption at rest for PostgreSQL, encrypted GitHub tokens in database
  - Secrets: Never log tokens or secrets, rotate secrets regularly
  - Dependency Security: Dependabot for automated vulnerability scanning, regular audits (npm audit, pip-audit)

  GitHub Integration Specifics:
  - OAuth App: For user authentication and basic repo access
  - GitHub App (Future): For deeper permissions (webhooks, write access) in Phase 2; OAuth App sufficient for MVP
  - Webhook Handling:
    - Idempotent handlers (handle duplicate webhook deliveries)
    - Signature verification (validate webhook authenticity)
    - Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed processing
    - Dead letter queue for persistently failing webhooks
  - Rate Limit Management:
    - Aggressive caching of GitHub data (repos, PRs, commits)
    - Webhook-based updates instead of polling
    - Request batching where possible
    - Graceful degradation if rate limit exhausted (show stale data with warning)

  Performance Targets (Restated from NFRs):
  - Page load: <1s cached, <2s cold start
  - View transitions: <500ms
  - Git operations: <3s
  - Real-time updates: <1s latency
  - Support 100+ concurrent users per workspace

  Compliance & Data Governance:
  - GDPR: User data export (JSON format), right to deletion (cascade deletes), privacy policy
  - Data Retention: Store Git event history (commits, PR updates) for 90 days by default, configurable per workspace
  - Audit Logs: Track user actions for admin visibility (future enterprise feature)
  - SOC 2: Deferred to enterprise tier post-MVP

  ---
  Rationale & Trade-offs:

  Monorepo vs Polyrepo:
  - Chose monorepo for MVP velocity; can split later if needed without user-facing impact

  Monolith vs Microservices:
  - Monolithic API avoids premature optimization; can extract microservices later if specific bottlenecks identified (e.g., webhook
  processing as separate service)
  - Job queue pattern provides async processing without full microservices complexity

  Testing Scope:
  - Unit + integration is pragmatic for MVP; E2E is expensive to maintain and slows down iteration
  - Focus on critical paths rather than comprehensive coverage

  Tech Stack Choices:
  - Next.js: Modern React framework with excellent DX, optimized performance, Vercel deployment option
  - FastAPI: Fastest Python web framework, async support, excellent docs, strong typing
  - PostgreSQL: Battle-tested, flexible JSONB, strong consistency (better than MongoDB for relational data like cards ‚Üî PRs)
  - Docker Compose: Simple orchestration for MVP; avoid Kubernetes complexity until scale demands it

  GitHub-First:
  - OAuth App for MVP (simpler), GitHub App for Phase 2 (more powerful but complex)
  - GitLab support deferred to validate GitHub market first

  Infrastructure:
  - Cloud-agnostic architecture (Docker-based) allows switching providers if needed
  - Managed services (PostgreSQL, Redis) reduce operational overhead for small team

  Areas Needing Validation:
  - Is Vercel deployment acceptable, or do you require self-hosted infrastructure for data sovereignty?
  - Should we support self-hosted GitHub Enterprise, or is GitHub.com-only sufficient for MVP?
  - Do you have existing cloud provider accounts/credits (AWS, GCP, Azure) that influence hosting choice?

  Goal: Deliver keyboard-driven workflows, bulk operations, and performance optimization for developer productivity.

  ---
  Detailed Rationale:

  Sequencing Logic:

  Epic 1 (Foundation) establishes the essential technical foundation while delivering a working, deployable application. This
  includes:
  - Project setup (Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend + Docker Compose)
  - GitHub OAuth for authentication (critical for all subsequent Git features)
  - Basic user/workspace management
  - Initial landing page and health check route (deployable functionality from day 1)
  - CI/CD pipeline setup

  This epic delivers immediate value (working auth + deployment) while laying groundwork for everything else.

  Epic 2 (Boards & Cards) builds the core product experience without Git complexity:
  - Users can create workspaces, boards, and cards
  - Drag-and-drop Kanban board with customizable columns
  - Full card metadata (title, description, assignees, labels, priority, story points, due dates, comments)
  - Activity timeline tracking changes
  - Team member invitations and basic permissions

  At the end of Epic 2, Taskly functions as a basic project management tool (like Trello) but without Git integration yet. This
  delivers standalone value and allows testing of core UX independently.

  Epic 3 (Git Integration) is where Taskly's differentiation comes alive:
  - Connect GitHub repos to workspace
  - Manual card-to-PR linking via URL
  - Auto-detection when branch/PR references card ID
  - One-click branch creation from cards
  - Webhook infrastructure for real-time sync
  - Display PR status, commits, CI status inline on cards
  - Auto-move cards when PRs merge

  This epic depends on Epic 1 (auth) and Epic 2 (cards exist to link) but delivers the core "Git-native" value proposition. Epic 3
  completion is the minimum viable product that validates the hypothesis.

  Epic 4 (Timeline View) adds manager-focused planning capabilities:
  - Timeline/sprint view UI (horizontal layout)
  - Sprint creation and management
  - Drag cards between sprints to rebalance workload
  - Visual capacity indicators (story points per sprint)
  - Filtering and grouping options

  This epic is independent of Epic 3 (doesn't require Git integration to function) but sequenced after to prioritize developer
  features first. Timeline view attracts manager adoption while developers already have boards + Git sync.

  Epic 5 (Power Features) delivers productivity enhancements that require stable foundation:
  - ‚åò+K command palette for quick actions
  - Keyboard shortcuts (J/K navigation, C create, E edit)
  - Multi-select cards (shift-click, lasso)
  - Batch operations (assign, label, move, change priority)
  - Performance optimization (caching, lazy loading, rendering optimizations)
  - UI polish and final bug fixes

  This epic comes last because it enhances existing features rather than building new ones. Keyboard shortcuts and bulk actions are
  high-impact but depend on all prior epics' functionality being stable.

  Epic Sizing Considerations:
  - Epic 1: ~2 weeks (infrastructure setup is time-intensive but well-understood)
  - Epic 2: ~2-3 weeks (substantial UI work, drag-and-drop library integration)
  - Epic 3: ~3 weeks (most complex due to webhook handling, GitHub API integration, async job processing)
  - Epic 4: ~1-2 weeks (mostly frontend work, less complexity than Epic 3)
  - Epic 5: ~1 week (enhancements on existing features, polish)

  Total Estimate: 9-11 weeks, aligning with brief's 8-10 week MVP timeline (with buffer for unknowns).

  Alternative Considered:
  - Could split Epic 3 into two (Epic 3a: Manual linking, Epic 3b: Automation/webhooks) to deliver incremental value faster. However,
  manual linking alone doesn't differentiate enough from competitors. Better to deliver full Git sync in one epic.
  - Could merge Epic 4 and Epic 5 to reduce epic count, but Timeline view is substantial enough to warrant its own epic, and keeping
  power features separate allows de-scoping if timeline pressure arises.

  Questions for Validation:
  1. Does this sequencing align with your development priorities? Any epics you'd reorder?
  2. Epic 3 is the heaviest‚Äîshould we split it into smaller increments (e.g., linking first, automation second)?
  3. Are there any cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, error handling) that should be explicit in Epic 1, or should they flow
   through all epics naturally?
  4. Should Epic 5 include any specific performance targets (e.g., Lighthouse scores, bundle size limits)?

  ---
  Rationale for Epic 1:

  Sequencing Logic:
  - Story 1.1 first because nothing else can be built without development environment
  - Story 1.2 early so all subsequent work is deployed continuously (avoid "deployment surprise" at end)
  - Story 1.3 provides data layer needed for Story 1.4's user records
  - Story 1.4 delivers core authentication‚Äîmust work before any user-facing features
  - Story 1.5 provides post-login experience, completing the authentication flow end-to-end

  Value Delivery:
  - By Story 1.3: Developers can build features locally with full stack running
  - By Story 1.4: Application is deployable with working authentication (demonstrates progress to stakeholders)
  - By Story 1.5: Complete authentication flow delivers first user-facing value

  Enabler Strategy:
  - Stories 1.1-1.3 are primarily enablers (infrastructure) but essential foundation
  - Stories 1.4-1.5 deliver user-facing value while depending on the enablers
  - Epic 1 avoids pure "infrastructure with no functionality"‚ÄîStory 1.1 delivers health check, Story 1.5 delivers landing page

  Sizing:
  - Each story scoped for single developer session (4-8 hours of focused work)
  - Story 1.3 is largest (database schema + migrations + models) but still completable in one focused day
  - Story 1.4 is complex (OAuth flow) but well-documented pattern with libraries to assist

  Dependencies:
  - Linear dependencies within epic (each story builds on previous)
  - No dependencies on future epics
  - All infrastructure needed for Epic 2 (boards/cards) is in place after Epic 1

  Rationale for Epic 2:

  Sequencing Logic:
  - Story 2.1 first: workspaces are containers for all other features
  - Story 2.2 next: teams need members before collaborating on boards
  - Story 2.3 provides boards/columns structure needed for Story 2.4's cards
  - Story 2.4 establishes basic card creation before advanced features
  - Story 2.5 delivers core Kanban drag-and-drop interaction (key UX differentiator)
  - Story 2.6 adds metadata for categorization/organization
  - Story 2.7 enables collaboration and audit trail (completes the "project management tool" experience)

  Value Delivery:
  - By Story 2.3: Users can create workspaces and boards (structural value)
  - By Story 2.5: Full Kanban workflow operational (core product value)
  - By Story 2.7: Collaboration and history tracking complete (team value)

  Vertical Slices:
  - Each story delivers end-to-end functionality (frontend + backend + database)
  - Story 2.5 is the largest (drag-and-drop complexity) but still completable in 1-2 focused days
  - Stories avoid "horizontal slicing" (e.g., "build all backend APIs first")‚Äîeach story ships working features

  Dependencies:
  - Linear dependencies within epic (each story builds on previous)
  - Epic 2 depends on Epic 1 (authentication, database, deployment pipeline)
  - Epic 3 (Git integration) depends on Epic 2 (cards must exist to link to PRs)

  Epic 3: Git Integration & Synchronization

  Expanded Goal: Implement bidirectional Git-native synchronization that connects Taskly boards directly to GitHub repositories. This
  epic delivers the core product differentiation: automatic branch creation from cards, card-to-PR linking with auto-detection,
  webhook-based real-time sync showing PR status and CI results inline on cards, and automatic card movement when PRs merge. By the
  end of this epic, Taskly transforms from a standalone project management tool into a Git-native "control surface for your repo,"
  eliminating double-entry and preserving task-to-code context automatically.

  ---
  Story 3.1: GitHub Repository Connection

  As a workspace admin,I want to connect GitHub repositories to my workspace,so that boards can integrate with code repositories.

  Acceptance Criteria

  3. Repository list displays: repository name, owner/org name, visibility indicator (public/private), star count, last updated
  timestamp
  4. Search/filter input allows finding repositories by name (client-side filtering for <100 repos, server-side search for larger
  lists)
  5. Selecting repository creates git_repositories record with: workspace_id, github_repo_id, owner, name, full_name (owner/repo),
  default_branch, is_active, connected_at timestamp
  6. Connected repositories list in workspace settings shows: repo full_name (owner/repo), GitHub link (opens in new tab),
  "Disconnect" button
  7. Disconnecting repository requires confirmation: "This will unlink all cards from PRs in this repository. Continue?"
  8. Disconnecting sets git_repositories.is_active = false (soft delete preserves historical data) and removes PR links from cards
  9. GitHub API uses authenticated user's OAuth token to fetch repositories (respects user's GitHub permissions)
  10. Repositories with no write access display warning: "Read-only access. Branch creation will not be available."
  11. Error handling: if GitHub API rate limit exhausted, display message "GitHub API limit reached. Try again in [X] minutes." with
  countdown timer
  12. Workspace can connect multiple repositories (supports mono-repo teams with separate backend/frontend repos)
  13. Board settings allow specifying default repository for that board (used for branch creation in Story 3.3)

  Story 3.2: Manual Card-to-PR Linking

  As a board member,I want to manually link cards to GitHub pull requests by pasting PR URLs,so that I can connect existing work to
  cards.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Card detail modal displays "Linked Pull Requests" section with "+ Link Pull Request" button
  2. Clicking button opens input field with placeholder: "Paste GitHub PR URL (e.g., https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123)"
  3. Pasting valid PR URL and clicking "Link" validates URL format and extracts owner, repo, PR number
  4. Backend fetches PR data from GitHub API: title, state (open/closed/merged), author, created_at, updated_at, head branch, base
  branch, mergeable status
  5. PR data stored in pull_requests table with: id (UUID), github_pr_id (unique), repository_id (FK), pr_number, title, state,
  author_github_id, head_branch, base_branch, url, fetched_at timestamp
  6. Card-PR relationship stored in card_pull_requests many-to-many table: card_id, pull_request_id, linked_at timestamp
  7. Linked PR displayed in card detail as compact card showing: PR number, title, state badge (open/draft/approved/merged with color
  coding), author avatar, branch names (head ‚Üí base)
  8. Multiple PRs linkable to single card (supports scenarios like frontend + backend PRs for one feature)
  9. PR state badge colors: gray (draft), blue (open), green (merged), purple (approved/ready), red (closed without merge)
  10. Clicking PR card opens GitHub PR in new browser tab
  11. Unlinking PR shows confirmation: "Remove link to PR #123?" with "Remove" and "Cancel" buttons
  12. Unlinking removes record from card_pull_requests table but preserves pull_requests record (other cards may link to same PR)
  13. Linked PRs displayed on card in column view as compact badge: "PR #123" with state indicator dot
  14. Error handling: invalid URL shows message "Invalid GitHub PR URL. Please check and try again."
  15. Error handling: PR from repository not connected to workspace shows message "Repository not connected. Connect it in workspace
  settings first."
  16. Error handling: GitHub API errors (network timeout, 404 not found, rate limit) display user-friendly messages with retry option

  Story 3.3: One-Click Branch Creation from Cards

  As a board member,I want to create GitHub branches directly from cards with one click,so that I can start coding without manual
  branch creation steps.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Card detail modal displays "Create Branch" button in Linked Pull Requests section (visible only if card has no linked PRs)
  2. Button shows repository selector dropdown if workspace has multiple connected repositories; uses board's default repository if
  only one connected
  3. Clicking "Create Branch" opens configuration modal with: repository selector (if multiple), branch name preview, base branch
  selector (defaults to repository's default_branch)
  4. Branch name auto-generated using pattern: feature/CARD-{card-id-short}-{title-kebab-case} (configurable in board settings)
  5. Branch name preview updates in real-time as user edits card title in modal; manual override allowed with text input
  6. Branch name validation: only lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores; no spaces or special characters (shows inline
  validation error if invalid)
  7. Submitting creates branch via GitHub API: POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs with ref refs/heads/{branch-name} pointing to base
  branch's HEAD SHA
  8. Branch creation triggers Celery background job (non-blocking) with job ID returned to frontend
  9. Frontend shows loading state: "Creating branch..." with spinner in card detail
  10. On success (within 3 seconds), displays success message: "Branch {branch-name} created" with GitHub link to branch
  11. Created branch automatically linked to card: backend creates draft PR via GitHub API (optional, configurable in board settings)
  and links PR to card per Story 3.2
  12. If draft PR creation enabled, PR description auto-populated with card details: title, description (markdown), acceptance
  criteria, link back to Taskly card
  13. Error handling: branch name already exists shows message "Branch {branch-name} already exists. Choose a different name or link
  existing PR."
  14. Error handling: insufficient GitHub permissions shows message "Cannot create branch. Requires write access to repository."
  15. Error handling: GitHub API errors (network issues, rate limits) display message with retry button and option to copy branch name
   for manual creation
  16. "Create Branch" button disabled (grayed out) if no repositories connected to workspace (tooltip: "Connect a repository in
  workspace settings first")
  17. Branch creation activity logged in card timeline: "[User] created branch {branch-name} in {repository}"

  ---
  Story 3.4: Webhook Infrastructure & PR Status Sync

  As a system,I want to receive GitHub webhooks and update card PR status in real-time,so that boards always reflect current code
  state without manual updates.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Backend exposes webhook endpoint: POST /api/webhooks/github accepting GitHub webhook payloads
  2. GitHub App or webhook configured for each connected repository subscribing to events: pull_request, pull_request_review, status,
  check_suite, push
  3. Webhook endpoint validates GitHub signature (HMAC SHA-256) using shared secret to prevent spoofing; invalid signatures return 401
   Unauthorized
  4. Webhook payloads parsed and enqueued to Celery background job for async processing (immediate 200 OK response to GitHub to
  prevent retries)
  5. pull_request webhook events (opened, closed, reopened, edited, ready_for_review, converted_to_draft) update pull_requests table:
  state, title, mergeable status, updated_at timestamp
  6. pull_request_review events (submitted, dismissed) update PR approval status; track approval count and reviewer list
  7. status and check_suite events update CI status tracked in pull_requests.ci_status JSONB field: {status: 
  'pending'|'success'|'failure', checks: [{name, status, url}]}
  8. push events to PR head branch update commit count and last commit SHA in pull_requests table
  9. After processing webhook, backend broadcasts update to frontend via WebSocket message: {type: 'pr_updated', pr_id: uuid, 
  card_ids: [uuid]}
  10. Frontend WebSocket listener receives message and updates affected cards in real-time: PR state badge changes, CI indicators
  update, commit count increments
  11. Cards linked to updated PR display updated status immediately without page refresh (optimistic UI already shows, webhook
  confirms)
  12. Webhook processing idempotent: duplicate webhook deliveries (GitHub retries) detected via event_id and skipped to prevent
  duplicate processing
  13. Failed webhook processing (e.g., database error) logged to error tracking (Sentry) and retried up to 3 times with exponential
  backoff (5s, 25s, 125s)
  14. Webhooks failing after 3 retries moved to dead letter queue (DLQ) for manual investigation; alerting triggered for engineering
  team
  15. Webhook processing metrics tracked: event type, processing time, success/failure rate (visible in admin dashboard for debugging)
  16. Rate limiting on webhook endpoint: max 100 requests per minute per repository to prevent abuse (returns 429 Too Many Requests if
   exceeded)
  17. CI status indicators displayed on card: green checkmark (all checks passed), red X (checks failed), yellow spinner (checks
  running), gray dash (no checks)

  ---
  Story 3.5: Auto-Display PR Status & Commits on Cards

  As a board member,I want to see PR status, commits, and CI results inline on cards,so that I have full context without leaving the
  board.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Cards with linked PRs display PR summary section in card detail modal below description, showing for each linked PR: PR number,
  title, state, author, created date, last updated date
  2. PR state displayed as color-coded badge: "Open" (blue), "Draft" (gray), "Ready for Review" (purple), "Approved" (green), "Merged"
   (dark green), "Closed" (red)
  3. PR summary shows branch information: "head-branch ‚Üí base-branch" with branch icons
  4. CI status indicator displayed prominently: green checkmark + "All checks passed", red X + "X checks failed", yellow spinner +
  "Checks running", gray dash + "No checks"
  5. Clicking CI status expands check details showing each check: name, status (success/failure/pending), external link to check
  details (e.g., GitHub Actions run)
  6. Commit count displayed: "X commits" with GitHub Octicon commit icon; clicking opens commit list modal
  7. Commit list modal shows most recent 10 commits: short SHA (7 chars), commit message (first line), author avatar, relative
  timestamp ("2 hours ago")
  8. Each commit in list links to GitHub commit page (opens in new tab)
  9. Approval status displayed: avatars of approving reviewers with count "2 approvals" or "Awaiting review" if none
  10. Mergeable status indicator: "Ready to merge" (green), "Merge conflicts" (red), "Checks required" (yellow)
  11. PR summary section updates in real-time via WebSocket when webhook events processed (state changes, new commits, CI updates)
  12. Column view (collapsed card) displays compact PR indicators: PR badge "PR #123", CI status dot (green/red/yellow), commit count
  if >0
  13. Hovering over collapsed PR indicators shows tooltip with full PR title and state
  14. Multiple linked PRs on single card displayed as stacked badges; clicking opens dropdown to select which PR to view details for
  15. PR data cached in pull_requests table and refreshed via webhooks; fallback manual refresh button in card detail (calls GitHub
  API immediately if data >5 minutes old)
  16. Empty state: if card has branch created (Story 3.3) but no PR yet, displays "Branch created: {branch-name}" with prompt "Create
  PR on GitHub" linking to GitHub's PR creation page with branch pre-selected

  ---
  Story 3.6: Auto-Move Cards on PR Merge

  As a board member,I want cards to automatically move to "Done" when linked PRs are merged,so that the board reflects code completion
   without manual updates.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. When pull_request webhook event with action closed and merged: true received, backend identifies all cards linked to that PR
  2. For each linked card, backend checks if auto-move enabled (board-level setting, defaults to true)
  3. If auto-move enabled, backend identifies "Done" column (configurable in board settings; defaults to column named "Done" or
  rightmost column)
  4. Backend updates card: sets cards.column_id to Done column, updates cards.position to top of column (position 0, other cards
  increment), sets cards.updated_at timestamp
  5. Activity log entry created in card timeline: "[GitHub] automatically moved card to Done (PR #{pr-number} merged)"
  6. Frontend receives WebSocket message: {type: 'card_moved', card_id: uuid, from_column: uuid, to_column: uuid, reason: 'pr_merged'}
  7. Card animates smoothly from current column to Done column in real-time for all users viewing board (animated slide with visual
  indicator like confetti or checkmark)
  8. Auto-move disabled if card already in Done column (idempotent)
  9. If card has multiple linked PRs, auto-move triggers only when all linked PRs are merged (configurable: "move when any PR merged"
  vs "move when all PRs merged")
  10. Board settings page includes "Automation" section with toggle: "Automatically move cards to Done when PRs merge" (on/off,
  defaults to on)
  11. Board settings allows selecting target column for auto-move via dropdown (lists all columns, defaults to "Done")
  12. Board settings includes PR merge behavior dropdown: "Move when any linked PR merges" vs "Move when all linked PRs merge"
  13. Users can manually move cards out of Done column after auto-move (no locking); manual moves do not disable future auto-moves
  14. Auto-move respects user permissions: if user who triggered PR merge lacks permission to edit board (e.g., removed from
  workspace), auto-move uses system actor "[GitHub]"
  15. Auto-move logic handles edge cases: column deleted (falls back to rightmost column), board archived (skips auto-move, logs
  warning)
  16. Failed auto-moves logged to error tracking with context (card ID, PR ID, error message) for debugging; user sees notification
  "Auto-move failed for card [title]. Please move manually."

  ---
  Story 3.7: Card ID Auto-Detection in Branch/PR Names

  As a board member,I want Taskly to automatically detect when PRs or branches reference card IDs,so that I don't have to manually
  link every PR.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. When webhook pull_request event (opened, edited) received, backend extracts PR head branch name and PR body text
  2. Backend searches for card ID patterns: CARD-{id}, card-{id}, #{id}, or Taskly card URL patterns in branch name and PR description
  3. If card ID found and matches existing card in workspace, backend automatically creates card-PR link in card_pull_requests table
  4. Multiple card IDs detected in single PR creates multiple links (e.g., PR addresses two cards)
  5. Auto-detected links displayed in card detail with indicator: "Auto-linked from branch name" or "Auto-linked from PR description"
  (distinguished from manual links)
  6. If PR description contains Taskly card URL (https://taskly.app/workspaces/{ws-id}/boards/{board-id}/cards/{card-id}), backend
  parses URL and links PR to that card
  7. Activity log entry created: "[GitHub] automatically linked PR #{pr-number} (detected in branch/PR description)"
  8. Frontend shows toast notification when auto-link created: "PR #{pr-number} automatically linked to this card"
  9. Auto-detected links user can unlink manually if incorrect (same unlink flow as Story 3.2)
  10. If branch created via Taskly (Story 3.3), branch name always includes card ID ensuring auto-detection works
  11. Card ID pattern matching case-insensitive: detects card-123, CARD-123, Card-123 equally
  12. Invalid card IDs (pattern matches but card doesn't exist) logged as debug info but do not create links or show errors
  13. Auto-detection runs on every relevant webhook event: pull_request opened, edited, reopened (handles cases where PR description
  updated to add card reference)
  14. Auto-detection respects repository permissions: only links PRs from repositories connected to workspace; PRs from unconnected
  repos ignored
  15. Duplicate auto-links prevented: if card-PR link already exists (manually created or previously auto-detected), skip creation
  (idempotent)

  Rationale for Epic 3:

  Sequencing Logic:
  - Story 3.1 first: must connect repositories before any Git operations
  - Story 3.2 provides manual linking foundation before automation
  - Story 3.3 delivers developer value (one-click branch creation) early
  - Story 3.4 establishes webhook infrastructure needed for Stories 3.5-3.7
  - Story 3.5 displays synced data (depends on 3.4's webhooks)
  - Story 3.6 delivers automation magic (auto-move on merge)
  - Story 3.7 reduces manual work via auto-detection (quality-of-life improvement)

  Value Delivery:
  - By Story 3.2: Manual PR linking validates card‚Üîcode connection hypothesis
  - By Story 3.3: One-click branch creation delivers time savings
  - By Story 3.5: Real-time PR status provides context for code reviews (core value prop)
  - By Story 3.6: Auto-move eliminates double-entry (core pain point solved)
  - By Story 3.7: Auto-detection further reduces friction

  Complexity Management:
  - Story 3.4 is most complex (webhooks, async processing, idempotency) but well-isolated
  - Each story delivers end-to-end value independently
  - Stories 3.5-3.7 build on 3.4's infrastructure incrementally

  Dependencies:
  - Epic 3 depends on Epic 1 (auth with GitHub) and Epic 2 (cards exist to link)
  - Stories within Epic 3 have linear dependencies (1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4, then 4‚Üí5/6/7)
  - Epic 4 (Timeline view) is independent of Epic 3 (can develop in parallel if needed)

  Epic 4: Timeline View & Sprint Planning

  Expanded Goal: Provide engineering managers and tech leads with powerful sprint planning and capacity management capabilities
  through a horizontal timeline view. This epic delivers visual workload distribution, drag-and-drop sprint rebalancing, capacity
  indicators showing overloaded sprints, and filtering capabilities. By the end of this epic, managers can plan sprints effectively,
  identify resource bottlenecks, and ensure balanced team workload‚Äîall while developers continue using the Kanban view for daily work.
   The multi-view approach validates Taskly's differentiation as more than just another board tool.

  Story 4.1: Sprint/Iteration Creation & Management

  As a workspace admin or board member,I want to create and manage sprints (iterations) for planning work over time,so that I can
  organize cards into time-boxed delivery cycles.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Board settings page includes "Sprints" section displaying list of existing sprints with "+ Create Sprint" button
  2. Clicking "+ Create Sprint" opens modal with fields: sprint name (required, e.g., "Sprint 1", "v1.0 Release"), start date (date
  picker), end date (date picker), goal (optional text, max 500 chars)
  3. Sprint dates validated: end date must be after start date; overlapping sprints allowed (warning displayed but not blocked)
  4. Creating sprint stores record in sprints table: id (UUID), board_id (FK), name, start_date, end_date, goal, status (enum:
  planned/active/completed), created_at, updated_at
  5. Sprint status automatically calculated: "planned" if start_date in future, "active" if current date between start/end,
  "completed" if end_date passed
  6. Sprints list in board settings shows: sprint name, date range ("Jan 1 - Jan 14"), status badge (planned/active/completed), card
  count, total story points, "Edit" and "Delete" buttons
  7. Active sprint highlighted with visual indicator (blue border, "Current Sprint" label)
  8. Editing sprint opens same modal pre-filled with existing values; updates sprint record on save
  9. Extending active sprint's end date shows confirmation: "Sprint is currently active. Extend end date to [new date]?"
  10. Deleting sprint requires confirmation: "Delete sprint? Cards will be moved to Backlog." with "Delete" and "Cancel" buttons
  11. Deleting sprint sets all cards' sprint_id to NULL (moves to "Backlog" in timeline view) and marks sprint as soft-deleted
  (deleted_at timestamp)
  12. Board header displays current active sprint name with progress indicator: "Sprint 2 (Day 5 of 14)" and story point completion
  ratio "12/25 points completed"
  13. Quick sprint navigation dropdown in board header lists all sprints with ability to filter cards by sprint in Kanban view
  14. Creating first sprint triggers onboarding tooltip: "Use Timeline view to drag cards into sprints for planning"

  ---
  Story 4.2: Timeline View UI & Basic Navigation

  As a board member,I want to switch to a timeline view showing sprints horizontally,so that I can visualize work distribution across
  time.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Board header includes view toggle buttons: "Kanban" (default) and "Timeline" with icons (list/calendar)
  2. Clicking "Timeline" transitions to timeline view within 500ms (smooth transition animation)
  3. Timeline view displays horizontal axis representing time: past sprints (left), current sprint (center, highlighted), future
  sprints (right), backlog (leftmost column)
  4. Each sprint rendered as vertical column with header showing: sprint name, date range, days remaining (for active sprint), story
  point total
  5. Current date indicator displayed as vertical red line spanning timeline height with "Today" label
  6. Sprints ordered chronologically left-to-right; backlog column always leftmost (for unassigned cards)
  7. Cards within each sprint column displayed as compact cards showing: card title, assignee avatars (max 3), priority indicator dot,
   story points badge, linked PR badge if present
  8. Empty sprints display placeholder: "Drag cards here to assign to sprint"
  9. Timeline view horizontally scrollable; current sprint auto-scrolled into view on initial load
  10. Zoom controls allow adjusting timeline density: "Day", "Week", "Month" granularity (affects column width and date labels)
  11. Timeline view persists user preference (last selected view stored in localStorage or user profile)
  12. Keyboard shortcut toggles views: "V" key cycles between Kanban and Timeline
  13. Timeline view responsive: desktop shows full horizontal layout, tablet (768px-1024px) shows condensed columns, mobile (<768px)
  falls back to Kanban view with message "Timeline view best viewed on desktop"
  14. Active filters (assignee, label, priority) from Kanban view carry over to Timeline view; filtered cards hidden in Timeline as
  well
  15. Card count and total story points displayed in each sprint header: "Sprint 1 (5 cards, 21 pts)"

  ---
  Story 4.3: Drag Cards Between Sprints in Timeline

  As a board member,I want to drag cards between sprints in timeline view,so that I can rebalance workload and adjust sprint scope.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Cards in timeline view draggable by clicking and holding (same @dnd-kit library as Kanban for consistency)
  2. Dragging card displays ghost preview following cursor; sprint columns highlight on hover showing valid drop zone
  3. Dropping card in target sprint column updates cards.sprint_id field to target sprint's ID and saves to database
  4. Dropping card in "Backlog" column sets cards.sprint_id to NULL (unassigns from sprint)
  5. Sprint headers update immediately on drop: card count, story point total recalculate and display new values
  6. Drag operation triggers optimistic UI update (card moves immediately) followed by API request; rollback if API fails with error
  toast
  7. Activity log entry created: "[User] moved card from [Sprint 1] to [Sprint 2]"
  8. Real-time sync: other users viewing timeline see card move via WebSocket broadcast message {type: 'card_sprint_changed', card_id:
   uuid, from_sprint: uuid, to_sprint: uuid}
  9. Keyboard alternative: focus card with Tab, press Space to "pick up," Left/Right arrow keys to move between sprints, Space again
  to "drop"
  10. Multi-select supported: Shift+Click or Ctrl+Click to select multiple cards, drag selection to bulk-assign to sprint
  11. Bulk sprint assignment updates all selected cards' sprint_id in single database transaction; activity log entry: "[User] moved 5
   cards to [Sprint 2]"
  12. Dragging disabled if user lacks edit permissions on board (cards appear locked with tooltip: "View-only access")
  13. Overloaded sprint indicator: if sprint's total story points exceed configured capacity (board setting, default 40 pts), sprint
  header shows warning badge "Overloaded" with red background
  14. Dragging card to overloaded sprint shows confirmation modal: "Sprint 2 is overloaded (45/40 pts). Add card anyway?" with "Yes"
  and "Cancel" options
  15. Sprint scope change tracking: when cards moved in/out of active sprint, board header progress indicator updates immediately:
  "12/30 points completed" ‚Üí "12/35 points completed"

  ---
  Story 4.4: Visual Capacity Indicators & Workload Balancing

  As a engineering manager,I want to see visual indicators showing sprint capacity and workload balance,so that I can identify
  overloaded sprints and distribute work evenly.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Each sprint column displays capacity bar at top showing story point utilization: horizontal bar with filled portion representing
  current points vs. capacity
  2. Capacity bar color-coded: green (0-80% capacity), yellow (80-100%), red (>100% overloaded)
  3. Capacity bar tooltip on hover shows exact numbers: "25 of 40 points assigned (62%)"
  4. Sprint capacity configurable at board level: board settings "Sprint Settings" section includes input "Default sprint capacity
  (story points)" (default 40)
  5. Individual sprint capacity overridable: editing sprint in board settings shows "Capacity (story points)" field defaulting to
  board-level value but editable per sprint
  6. Overloaded sprints (>100% capacity) display warning icon in header with tooltip: "Sprint is overloaded. Consider moving cards to
  another sprint."
  7. Timeline view includes "Capacity Overview" toggle in header: when enabled, shows aggregated view across all sprints as line chart
   overlaying timeline
  8. Capacity overview line chart plots story points per sprint with horizontal reference line at capacity threshold; spikes above
  line indicate overloaded sprints
  9. Team capacity mode (advanced): board settings "Sprint Settings" section includes toggle "Track by assignee capacity"
  10. When team capacity mode enabled, capacity bar shows per-assignee workload: stacked bar segments colored by assignee with each
  segment representing their assigned story points
  11. Assignee capacity limits configurable: workspace settings "Team Members" section includes per-member field "Sprint capacity
  (story points)" (default 20)
  12. Hovering over assignee segment in capacity bar shows: "[Username]: 15 of 20 points assigned"
  13. Over-assigned team members highlighted in timeline: if assignee has >100% capacity across multiple sprints, their avatar
  displays red warning dot
  14. Filtering timeline by assignee isolates their cards across sprints, showing only their workload distribution (useful for 1:1s
  and workload discussions)
  15. Sprint health score calculated and displayed in header: "Balanced" (all assignees <100%), "Unbalanced" (one or more assignees
  >100%), "Overloaded" (sprint total >100%)

  Story 4.5: Sprint Planning Workflow & Bulk Actions

  As a engineering manager,I want to efficiently plan sprints with bulk operations and filtering,so that I can quickly organize large
  backlogs into sprints.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Timeline view header includes "Planning Mode" toggle button; when enabled, UI switches to planning-optimized layout
  2. Planning mode displays backlog column wider (30% of viewport) with other sprints condensed; backlog sorted by priority (Urgent ‚Üí
  High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low ‚Üí None)
  3. Planning mode enables multi-select by default: clicking card selects (checkmark appears), Ctrl+Click to deselect, Shift+Click to
  select range
  4. Selected cards highlighted with blue border; selection count displayed in floating action bar: "5 cards selected" with bulk
  action buttons
  5. Bulk action bar includes buttons: "Assign to Sprint" (dropdown lists sprints), "Set Priority" (dropdown), "Add Label" (dropdown),
   "Assign to Member" (dropdown), "Clear Selection"
  6. Selecting "Assign to Sprint" from bulk actions moves all selected cards to chosen sprint in single database transaction; activity
   log: "[User] moved 5 cards to [Sprint 2]"
  7. Right sidebar in planning mode shows sprint statistics panel: each sprint listed with name, date range, card count, story points,
   capacity utilization bar, "Add Cards" button
  8. Clicking sprint's "Add Cards" button in stats panel opens sprint in focused view: backlog on left, selected sprint on right,
  simplified two-column layout for focused planning
  9. Keyboard shortcuts in planning mode: "A" to select all visible cards, "Escape" to clear selection, "1-9" number keys to
  quick-assign selected cards to sprint N
  10. Quick filters in timeline header: "No Sprint" (shows only backlog), "Current Sprint", "Upcoming Sprints", "Overdue Cards" (due
  date passed, not completed), "Unassigned" (no assignee)
  11. Search input in timeline header filters cards by title/description across all sprints; matching cards highlighted, non-matching
  cards dimmed
  12. Sprint templates: board settings includes "Sprint Templates" section for creating reusable sprint patterns (e.g., "2-week
  Sprint" with 10 working days, 40 pt capacity)
  13. Creating sprint from template pre-fills all settings: duration, capacity, optionally copies cards from previous sprint (useful
  for recurring maintenance sprints)
  14. Export sprint plan: timeline view includes "Export" button generating CSV with columns: Card Title, Sprint, Assignees, Priority,
   Story Points, Due Date, Status
  15. Undo/redo support for sprint planning actions: Ctrl+Z undoes last bulk assignment, Ctrl+Shift+Z redoes; undo stack persists for
  current session only

  Rationale for Epic 4:

  Sequencing Logic:
  - Story 4.1 first: sprints must exist before timeline can visualize them
  - Story 4.2 builds core timeline UI and navigation (foundational view)
  - Story 4.3 adds interactivity (drag-and-drop) enabling actual planning work
  - Story 4.4 delivers manager value (capacity insights)
  - Story 4.5 provides power tools for efficient planning (bulk actions, planning mode)

  Value Delivery:
  - By Story 4.2: Timeline view visible, managers can see sprint layout
  - By Story 4.3: Sprint planning functional (drag cards, rebalance workload)
  - By Story 4.4: Capacity management addresses "workload distribution" pain point from brief
  - By Story 4.5: Bulk operations make planning large backlogs efficient

  Manager vs Developer Focus:
  - Epic 1-3 prioritized developer workflows (boards, cards, Git integration)
  - Epic 4 shifts to manager persona (sprint planning, capacity, team workload)
  - Timeline view optional: developers can stay in Kanban, managers use Timeline for planning

  Complexity Management:
  - Story 4.2 is mostly frontend work (rendering timeline UI)
  - Story 4.3 reuses @dnd-kit from Kanban (consistent UX, less new code)
  - Story 4.4 involves calculation logic (capacity bars, aggregations) but straightforward
  - Story 4.5 bundles multiple small features (bulk actions, filters) that enhance planning workflow

  Dependencies:
  - Epic 4 depends on Epic 2 (cards, boards must exist)
  - Epic 4 independent of Epic 3 (timeline works without Git integration)
  - Epic 5 (keyboard shortcuts) could theoretically run parallel to Epic 4, but sequenced after to ensure core features stable first

  Epic 5: Power User Features & Polish

  Expanded Goal: Deliver productivity enhancements that transform Taskly from a functional tool into a delightful daily driver for
  power users. This epic implements keyboard-first workflows through a command palette (‚åò+K) and comprehensive shortcuts, advanced
  bulk operations with multi-select and lasso selection, and performance optimizations ensuring sub-second interactions. By the end of
   this epic, Taskly demonstrates "developer respect" through speed, efficiency, and polish‚Äîvalidating the "zero-friction UX"
  philosophy and completing the MVP ready for beta launch.

  ---
  Story 5.1: Command Palette (‚åò+K) Implementation

  As a power user,I want a keyboard-accessible command palette for quick actions,so that I can perform common tasks without using my
  mouse.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Pressing ‚åò+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux) opens command palette overlay from any screen
  2. Command palette displays as centered modal (800px width) with search input focused automatically
  3. Search input supports fuzzy matching: typing "cre card" matches "Create Card" command
  4. Command list displays below search input showing: command name, description (gray text), keyboard shortcut (if applicable), icon
  5. Commands grouped by category with section headers: "Navigation", "Card Actions", "Board Actions", "View Controls"
  6. Navigation commands: "Go to Dashboard", "Go to Board Settings", "Go to Workspace Settings", "Switch Workspace" (shows workspace
  list on select)
  7. Card actions: "Create Card" (prompts for column selection then opens quick-create), "Search Cards" (switches to card search
  mode), "Filter by Assignee", "Filter by Label"
  8. Board actions: "Create Board", "Switch Board" (shows board list), "Create Sprint", "Export Board"
  9. View controls: "Switch to Kanban View", "Switch to Timeline View", "Toggle Dark Mode", "Toggle Planning Mode"
  10. Arrow keys (‚Üë/‚Üì) navigate command list; Enter executes selected command; Escape closes palette
  11. Recently used commands appear at top of list (max 5) for quick access with "Recent" section header
  12. Command palette supports command chaining: executing "Create Card" keeps palette open with "Which column?" sub-menu for
  multi-step workflows
  13. Commands dynamically enable/disable based on context: "Switch to Kanban View" disabled when already in Kanban view, "Create
  Sprint" disabled if no board selected
  14. Command palette supports direct card search mode: typing "#" prefix switches to card search showing matching cards with keyboard
   navigation to open selected card
  15. Custom keyboard shortcuts configurable: user settings page includes "Keyboard Shortcuts" section listing all commands with
  editable shortcut fields
  16. Command palette renders in <100ms on open with no lag during typing (search debounced at 150ms)
  17. Command palette accessible from any page (global hotkey listener) and adapts commands to current context (board vs. workspace
  vs. settings)

  ---
  Story 5.2: Keyboard Navigation & Shortcuts

  As a power user,I want comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for common actions,so that I can navigate and manipulate boards without
  touching my mouse.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Card navigation shortcuts: "J" moves focus to next card, "K" moves to previous card (Gmail-style), Tab cycles through cards in
  column order
  2. Focused card indicated with blue outline border; pressing Enter opens card detail modal
  3. Card manipulation: "E" edits focused card (opens detail modal), "D" deletes card (with confirmation), "M" opens move menu (arrow
  keys select column, Enter confirms)
  4. Column navigation: Ctrl+‚Üê moves focus to previous column, Ctrl+‚Üí moves to next column
  5. Card creation: "C" opens quick-create input in currently focused column (or first column if no focus)
  6. Multi-select: Shift+‚Üë/‚Üì extends selection to adjacent cards, Ctrl+Click (or Cmd+Click on Mac) adds individual card to selection
  7. Selection actions: "A" selects all cards in focused column, Ctrl+A selects all visible cards on board, Escape clears selection
  8. View switching: "V" cycles through views (Kanban ‚Üí Timeline ‚Üí Kanban), "1" forces Kanban view, "2" forces Timeline view
  9. Search: "/" activates board-wide search input (same as clicking search box), Escape closes search and clears filters
  10. Undo/Redo: Ctrl+Z undoes last action (card move, edit, delete), Ctrl+Shift+Z redoes undone action (session-based, not
  persistent)
  11. Global shortcuts work across entire app: "G then D" navigates to Dashboard, "G then S" navigates to Settings (Gmail-style
  sequential shortcuts)
  12. Modal shortcuts: Enter submits form in modals (Create Board, Create Sprint), Escape closes modal without saving
  13. Timeline-specific: Left/Right arrow keys pan timeline horizontally, "+"/"-" zoom in/out timeline density
  14. Shortcut help overlay: pressing "?" displays cheat sheet modal showing all available shortcuts organized by category
  15. Shortcuts configurable: Settings page "Keyboard Shortcuts" section allows remapping any shortcut (prevents conflicts, shows
  warning if duplicate)
  16. Shortcuts respect focus context: text input fields disable navigation shortcuts (J/K/C/etc.) to prevent interference with
  typing; Escape re-enables
  17. Visual feedback: when shortcut triggered, brief animation or highlight confirms action (e.g., "C" pressed ‚Üí column highlight
  flash before quick-create appears)

  ---
  Story 5.3: Multi-Select & Lasso Selection

  As a board member,I want to select multiple cards at once for bulk operations,so that I can efficiently manage large numbers of
  cards.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Multi-select enabled in Kanban view: clicking checkbox icon in card corner (appears on hover) selects card
  2. Selected cards display visual indicator: blue border, semi-transparent blue overlay, checkmark in corner
  3. Shift+Click on card selects all cards between last selected card and clicked card (range selection)
  4. Ctrl+Click (Cmd+Click on Mac) toggles individual card selection without affecting other selections
  5. Lasso selection: Click and drag in empty board space draws selection rectangle; all cards overlapping rectangle when mouse
  released are selected
  6. Lasso visual: semi-transparent blue rectangle with dashed border follows cursor during drag
  7. Selection count displayed in floating toolbar at bottom of screen: "5 cards selected" with action buttons
  8. Floating toolbar buttons: "Assign" (assignee dropdown), "Label" (label dropdown), "Priority" (priority dropdown), "Move to
  Column" (column dropdown), "Delete" (with confirmation), "Clear Selection"
  9. Bulk actions apply to all selected cards in single API request (batch endpoint: POST /api/cards/bulk-update with card IDs array
  and update payload)
  10. Bulk update optimistic: UI updates immediately for all selected cards, rollback if API fails with error toast showing failed
  count
  11. Activity log entries for bulk actions: "[User] assigned 5 cards to [Username]", "[User] added label 'Bug' to 3 cards"
  12. Select all button in board header: "Select All" checkbox selects all visible cards (respects active filters)
  13. Indeterminate checkbox state: if some but not all cards selected, checkbox shows indeterminate state (dash icon)
  14. Keyboard support: "A" selects all in focused column, Ctrl+A selects all visible on board, Shift+J/K extends selection up/down
  15. Selection persists across view switches: selecting cards in Kanban then switching to Timeline preserves selection
  16. Selection cleared on: Escape key, clicking "Clear Selection" button, performing destructive action like delete, leaving board
  (navigating away)
  17. Mobile/tablet touch support: long-press card (500ms) enters multi-select mode with checkboxes appearing on all cards

  ---
  Story 5.4: Advanced Bulk Operations & Batch Editing

  As a board member,I want powerful bulk editing capabilities for selected cards,so that I can quickly update multiple cards with
  consistent changes.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Floating toolbar (Story 5.3) includes "Edit Multiple" button opening bulk edit modal
  2. Bulk edit modal displays fields: Title Prefix/Suffix (add text to all titles), Description Append (add text to end of all
  descriptions), Assignees (add/remove), Labels (add/remove), Priority (set), Story Points (set or adjust by +/- amount), Due Date
  (set or offset by days), Sprint Assignment
  3. Field-level checkboxes: user selects which fields to update (prevents accidental overwrites)
  4. Preview section in modal shows first 3 affected cards with before/after comparison for selected fields
  5. Title prefix/suffix examples: prefix "URGENT: " to all selected cards, suffix " (deprecated)" to cards
  6. Assignees bulk action modes: "Add assignees to existing" (keeps current, adds new), "Replace all assignees" (removes current,
  sets new), "Remove specific assignees" (unassign selected members)
  7. Labels bulk action similar: "Add labels", "Replace labels", "Remove labels" modes
  8. Story points adjustment: "Set to value" (overwrite), "Increase by X", "Decrease by X" modes
  9. Due date operations: "Set to specific date", "Add X days to existing dates", "Remove due dates"
  10. Sprint assignment: "Assign to sprint" (dropdown), "Remove from sprint" (moves to backlog)
  11. Applying bulk edit executes single POST /api/cards/bulk-update request with all changes; backend processes in database
  transaction (all or nothing)
  12. Progress indicator during bulk update: "Updating 25 cards..." with spinner; success message: "25 cards updated successfully"
  13. Error handling: if bulk update fails for some cards (e.g., validation errors), shows partial success message: "20 of 25 cards
  updated. 5 failed." with details button expanding error list
  14. Undo support: bulk edit actions added to undo stack; Ctrl+Z reverts entire bulk operation (restores all changed cards to
  previous state)
  15. Activity log: single aggregated entry "[User] bulk updated 25 cards (changed priority, added labels)" rather than 25 separate
  entries
  16. Bulk operations respect permissions: cards user lacks edit permission for are excluded from bulk update with warning: "2 cards
  skipped (no edit permission)"
  17. Rate limiting protection: bulk updates >100 cards chunked into batches of 50 with brief delays to prevent database overload

  ---
  Story 5.5: Performance Optimization & Final Polish

  As a user,I want Taskly to feel fast and responsive at all times,so that the tool doesn't slow me down during daily work.

  Acceptance Criteria

  1. Page load performance: initial load <1 second (cached), <2 seconds (cold start) measured with Lighthouse performance score >90
  2. View transitions: switching Kanban ‚Üî Timeline completes in <500ms with smooth animation (no janky frames)
  3. Large board performance: boards with 500+ cards render without lag using virtualization (only visible cards rendered in DOM)
  4. Lazy loading: images (avatars, attachments) loaded on-demand with placeholder; below-fold content loaded after initial render
  5. Optimistic UI: all user actions (card move, edit, delete) update UI immediately with API call in background; rollback on failure
  with error toast
  6. Debouncing: search input, filters, and inline editing debounced at 300ms to reduce API calls during rapid typing
  7. Caching strategy: frequently accessed data (boards list, user profile, workspace members) cached in frontend with 5-minute TTL;
  cache invalidated on updates
  8. Bundle size optimization: frontend JavaScript bundle <500KB gzipped; code splitting by route (dashboard, board, settings as
  separate chunks)
  9. Lighthouse PWA score >90: manifest file, service worker for offline fallback (shows "You're offline" message), app installable as
   PWA
  10. Accessibility audit: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified with axe DevTools (0 critical violations, <5 minor issues)
  11. Error boundaries: React error boundaries catch crashes and display user-friendly error page with "Reload" button (errors logged
  to Sentry)
  12. Loading states: all asynchronous operations display skeleton loaders or spinners within 100ms (no blank screens)
  13. Empty states: all empty data scenarios (no boards, no cards, no workspaces) show helpful empty state illustrations with clear
  CTAs
  14. Final UI polish: consistent spacing (8px grid system), typography (single font stack), colors (design system with CSS
  variables), animations (200ms standard, 300ms complex)
  15. Cross-browser testing: verified in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge with no major visual or functional issues
  16. Mobile responsive: all features functional on tablet (768px+) with touch-optimized interactions; mobile (<768px) shows
  streamlined read-only view with message "Full editing experience available on desktop"
  17. Production monitoring: Sentry configured for error tracking, Datadog/Prometheus for metrics (API latency, page load times, error
   rates), uptime monitoring active

  Rationale for Epic 5:

  Sequencing Logic:
  - Story 5.1 first: command palette is foundational power tool, enables efficient testing of other features
  - Story 5.2 builds on 5.1: shortcuts complement command palette, together form keyboard-first experience
  - Story 5.3 enables multi-select: required for Story 5.4's bulk operations
  - Story 5.4 delivers bulk editing power: high-value feature for managing large backlogs
  - Story 5.5 last: performance optimization and polish applied to all completed features

  Value Delivery:
  - By Story 5.1: Power users can work efficiently via command palette
  - By Story 5.2: Keyboard shortcuts deliver "zero-friction" UX promise from brief
  - By Story 5.3-5.4: Bulk operations solve "tedious project management" pain point
  - By Story 5.5: Production-ready polish ensures excellent first impression for beta users

  "Polish" Philosophy:
  - Epic 5 enhances existing features rather than building new ones
  - Each story makes the product more delightful without changing core functionality
  - Performance optimization ensures MVP success criteria met (<1s load, <500ms transitions from NFRs)

  Developer Adoption:
  - Command palette + shortcuts are table stakes for developer tools
  - These features signal "we respect your time and workflows"
  - Power users become advocates: they'll demo ‚åò+K to teammates, driving viral adoption

  MVP Completion:
  - Epic 5 completes all MVP features from brief
  - After Epic 5, Taskly ready for beta testing
  - Total epic time: ~1 week (mostly frontend polish, least complex epic)

  Top Issues by Priority

  BLOCKERS: None ‚úÖ

  No blocking issues identified. PRD is ready for architectural design phase.

  HIGH PRIORITY: None

  All high-priority elements are complete and well-documented.

  MEDIUM PRIORITY:

  1. User Research Validation - PRD based on Project Brief assumptions; recommend conducting 10-20 user interviews during Epic 1-2
  development to validate pain points and feature priorities
  2. Stakeholder Approval Process - Document format (Add "Approved by" section to Change Log once stakeholders review)

  LOW PRIORITY:

  1. Wireframes/Mockups - UI Design Goals section is comprehensive but could benefit from visual mockups (acceptable to defer to UX
  Expert phase)
  2. API Documentation Preview - Detailed API specs deferred to Architect (appropriate division of responsibility)

  ---
  MVP Scope Assessment

  Scope Analysis:

  ‚úÖ Well-Balanced MVP - The 5 epic structure delivers:
  - Epic 1: Essential foundation (infrastructure, auth, deployment)
  - Epic 2: Core product value (boards, cards, drag-and-drop)
  - Epic 3: Key differentiation (Git integration, webhooks, auto-sync)
  - Epic 4: Manager persona value (timeline view, sprint planning)
  - Epic 5: Developer delight (keyboard shortcuts, performance)

  Features Appropriately Scoped:
  - GitHub-only (GitLab deferred) ‚úÖ
  - Web-only (no mobile apps) ‚úÖ
  - Manual linking before automation (incremental complexity) ‚úÖ
  - Limited E2E testing (pragmatic for MVP) ‚úÖ

  No Missing Essential Features - All core brief requirements translated to epics/stories.

  Complexity Concerns Addressed:
  - Epic 3 (Git integration) is most complex but well-structured into 7 incremental stories
  - Webhook infrastructure (Story 3.4) has detailed error handling, retry logic, idempotency requirements

  Timeline Realism:
  - 9-11 week estimate for 29 stories is aggressive but achievable with 1-2 developers
  - Epics 1-3 are critical path; Epics 4-5 could be descoped if timeline pressure arises
  - Story sizing appears appropriate (4-8 hours per story average)

  Recommendation: Proceed with current scope. Monitor Epic 3 velocity closely as it's the highest-risk/highest-value epic.

  ---
  Technical Readiness

  Clarity of Technical Constraints ‚úÖ

  Excellent. The "Technical Assumptions" section provides:
  - Specific technology stack (Next.js 14+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL 15+, Docker Compose)
  - Architecture decisions with rationale (monorepo, monolithic API, Celery job queue)
  - Testing strategy (unit + integration, limited E2E)
  - Security requirements (OAuth, JWT, encryption, rate limiting)
  - Infrastructure approach (Docker Compose, managed cloud services)
  - GitHub integration specifics (OAuth App for MVP, webhooks, rate limit handling)

  Identified Technical Risks ‚úÖ

  PRD explicitly calls out:
  - GitHub API rate limits (5000 req/hour) - mitigation via caching and webhooks
  - Webhook reliability (idempotency, retry logic, dead letter queue)
  - Real-time WebSocket complexity (with fallback to polling)
  - Performance targets (<1s page load, <500ms view transitions, <3s Git ops)

  Areas Needing Architect Investigation

  Appropriately Flagged:
  1. GitHub App vs OAuth App - PRD notes OAuth sufficient for MVP, GitHub App for Phase 2 (architect should validate)
  2. Webhook Infrastructure - Complex async processing, architect needs to design Celery task structure
  3. Database Schema Details - PRD provides high-level entities, architect will design full schema with indexes
  4. WebSocket Architecture - Integrated vs separate service decision deferred to architect
  5. Deployment Platform - PRD suggests AWS/GCP/DigitalOcean, architect chooses specific services

  Assessment: Appropriate division between PM and Architect responsibilities. PM provided constraints and direction, architect will
  handle implementation details.

  ---
  Detailed Category Findings

  1. Problem Definition & Context ‚úÖ PASS

  Strengths:
  - Clear problem statement in Background Context (double-entry tax, context loss in code review, preventable rework)
  - Specific target audience (5-50 developer teams using GitHub + Trello/Jira/Linear)
  - Differentiation from competitors explicitly stated
  - Success metrics defined (though in Project Brief, not in PRD - acceptable reference)

  Minor Gap: PRD references Project Brief for full problem analysis but doesn't duplicate all details. This is acceptable‚Äîbrief is
  source of truth for problem/market context, PRD focuses on solution specification.

  2. MVP Scope Definition ‚úÖ PASS

  Strengths:
  - MVP features clearly listed in Epic summaries
  - Post-MVP vision documented in brief (not duplicated in PRD, appropriate)
  - Rationale for scope decisions evident in story acceptance criteria
  - Each story delivers user value or enables future stories (no pure "tech debt" stories)

  Validation Approach: Stories include testable acceptance criteria. MVP success criteria in brief define validation approach (70%+
  find linking useful, 3+ hours saved/week, 90%+ Git sync success).

  3. User Experience Requirements ‚úÖ PASS

  Strengths:
  - "User Interface Design Goals" section comprehensively covers UX vision, interaction paradigms, core screens
  - Accessibility target (WCAG AA) specified
  - Performance expectations from user perspective (NFR1-4: <1s load, <500ms transitions)
  - Error handling mentioned throughout acceptance criteria (e.g., GitHub API failures, validation errors)

  User Flows: Documented in story format (Epic 1.5: login ‚Üí dashboard, Epic 2: workspace ‚Üí board ‚Üí card creation). Detailed flows
  deferred to UX Expert (appropriate).

  4. Functional Requirements ‚úÖ PASS

  Strengths:
  - 18 Functional Requirements (FR1-FR18) cover all MVP features
  - Requirements focus on WHAT not HOW (e.g., FR7 says "update within 1 second" not "use WebSockets")
  - Each requirement testable (can verify in QA)
  - Dependencies implicit in FR numbering (e.g., FR6 branch creation depends on FR3 GitHub connection)
  - User Stories provide detailed functional specifications (29 stories √ó 10-17 ACs each = ~350 acceptance criteria)

  Quality: Requirements use consistent terminology ("card", "board", "workspace", "sprint"). No technical jargon without context.

  5. Non-Functional Requirements ‚úÖ PASS

  Strengths:
  - 12 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR1-NFR12) covering performance, scalability, security, compliance
  - Specific measurable targets (NFR1: <1s cached load, NFR3: <3s Git operations, NFR5: 100+ concurrent users)
  - Security requirements comprehensive (NFR8-10: HTTPS/TLS 1.3, JWT with expiration, rate limiting)
  - GDPR compliance specified (NFR11)
  - GitHub API rate limit constraint explicitly called out (NFR12)

  Coverage: Performance ‚úÖ, Security ‚úÖ, Reliability (implied in Epic 1.2 CI/CD, Epic 3.4 webhooks), Technical Constraints ‚úÖ

  6. Epic & Story Structure ‚úÖ PASS

  Strengths:
  - Epic 1 (Foundation): Includes all setup (dev environment, CI/CD, database, auth, landing page) - properly frontloaded
  - Epic Cohesion: Each epic delivers cohesive value (Epic 2 = complete project management tool, Epic 3 = Git-native differentiation)
  - Story Independence: Most stories independent within epics (e.g., Epic 2 stories build on each other but are individually
  completable)
  - Story Sizing: All stories include 10-17 acceptance criteria, scoped for 4-8 hour sessions
  - Acceptance Criteria Quality: Testable, specific, include error cases and edge cases

  Sequence Logic:
  - Epic 1 ‚Üí Epic 2: Must have auth/database before boards
  - Epic 2 ‚Üí Epic 3: Must have cards before linking to PRs
  - Epic 3 ‚ä• Epic 4: Git integration independent of Timeline view (could parallelize)
  - Epic 5 final: Polish and performance applied to all completed features

  First Epic Completeness: ‚úÖ Story 1.1 (dev environment), 1.2 (CI/CD), 1.3 (database/models), 1.4 (auth), 1.5 (landing page). All
  necessary setup addressed.

  7. Technical Guidance ‚úÖ PASS

  Strengths:
  - "Technical Assumptions" section is exceptionally comprehensive (2000+ words)
  - Architecture direction provided (monorepo, monolithic API with job queue, Docker Compose)
  - Technical constraints clearly stated (GitHub-only, Next.js 14+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL 15+)
  - Integration points identified (GitHub OAuth, GitHub API, webhooks)
  - Performance considerations highlighted (virtualization for 500+ cards, caching strategy)
  - Security requirements articulated (OAuth, JWT, encryption at rest, rate limiting)
  - Technical risks flagged (GitHub API rate limits, webhook reliability, WebSocket complexity)

  Decision Framework:
  - Trade-offs articulated (monorepo vs polyrepo, monolith vs microservices, OAuth App vs GitHub App)
  - Rationale documented (e.g., "monolith simpler for MVP scale <10k users", "Docker Compose avoids Kubernetes complexity")
  - Non-negotiables clear (GitHub-only for MVP, WCAG AA compliance, <3s Git operations)

  Implementation Guidance:
  - Testing requirements detailed (Unit + Integration, limited E2E, pytest/Jest, coverage targets)
  - Deployment expectations set (Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, staging environment)
  - Monitoring needs identified (Sentry error tracking, Prometheus/Datadog metrics, uptime monitoring)

  8. Cross-Functional Requirements ‚úÖ PASS

  Data Requirements:
  - Core entities identified (users, workspaces, boards, cards, git_repositories, pull_requests)
  - Relationships specified (many-to-many: cards ‚Üî PRs, users ‚Üî workspaces)
  - Storage approach defined (PostgreSQL JSONB for flexible metadata)
  - Data retention mentioned (90 days for Git events, configurable)
  - Schema evolution strategy: Story 1.3 establishes foundation, subsequent stories add tables as needed

  Integration Requirements:
  - GitHub OAuth specified (Story 1.4)
  - GitHub REST API integration detailed (Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
  - Webhook integration comprehensive (Story 3.4: events, signature validation, retry logic)
  - Email integration mentioned (Story 2.2: SendGrid or AWS SES)

  Operational Requirements:
  - Deployment frequency: continuous (Epic 1.2 CI/CD auto-deploys on merge)
  - Environments: local (Docker Compose), staging (auto-deployed), production (manual gate)
  - Monitoring: Sentry, Datadog/Prometheus, uptime monitoring (Story 5.5)
  - Support: GitHub Issues implied, admin dashboard for metrics (mentioned in webhook section)

  9. Clarity & Communication ‚úÖ PASS

  Documentation Quality:
  - Clear, consistent language (no jargon without definition)
  - Well-structured (Goals ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí UI Goals ‚Üí Technical ‚Üí Epics ‚Üí Stories ‚Üí Next Steps)
  - Technical terms defined contextually (e.g., "OAuth 2.0 for GitHub integration", "JWT tokens with 15 min expiration")
  - Markdown formatting makes PRD readable (headers, lists, tables, bold for emphasis)
  - Version tracked in Change Log table

  Stakeholder Alignment:
  - Key stakeholders identified in brief (developers, engineering managers as primary personas)
  - Stakeholder input incorporated (brief based on problem analysis, MVP scope addresses both personas)
  - No identified disagreements (greenfield project, single decision-maker assumed)
  - Communication plan: PRD ‚Üí UX Expert ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Dev (handoff prompts in "Next Steps")
  - Approval process: TBD (add stakeholder sign-off to Change Log)

  Recommendations

  Immediate Actions (Before Handoff to UX Expert/Architect)

  1. ‚úÖ COMPLETE - PRD is comprehensive and ready for next phase
  2. OPTIONAL: Add "Approved By" row to Change Log once stakeholders review
  3. OPTIONAL: Schedule 10 user interviews during Epic 1-2 development to validate assumptions (can run parallel to dev)

  Handoff to UX Expert

  Recommended Prompt:
  Please create detailed UI/UX design specifications for Taskly based on the PRD at docs/prd.md. Focus on:

  1. Wireframes/mockups for core screens (Kanban board, Timeline view, card detail modal, command palette)
  2. Design system (color palette, typography, iconography, spacing grid)
  3. Interaction patterns (drag-and-drop behavior, keyboard shortcuts, animations)
  4. Responsive layouts (desktop 1280px+, tablet 768-1024px, mobile <768px fallbacks)
  5. Dark mode implementation
  6. Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA keyboard navigation, screen reader support, focus indicators)

  Reference "User Interface Design Goals" section for vision and requirements. Deliver design system documentation and Figma/Sketch
  files ready for developer implementation.

  Handoff to Architect

  Recommended Prompt:
  Please create comprehensive technical architecture documentation for Taskly based on the PRD at docs/prd.md. Focus on:

  1. Database schema (full ERD with tables, columns, indexes, relationships)
  2. API specifications (REST endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication)
  3. WebSocket event specifications (message formats, connection lifecycle)
  4. Webhook processing architecture (Celery task structure, retry logic, dead letter queue)
  5. GitHub integration patterns (OAuth flow, API client design, rate limit handling)
  6. Deployment architecture (Docker Compose services, CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure diagram)
  7. Security architecture (authentication flow, authorization model, encryption strategy)
  8. Performance optimizations (caching strategy, query optimization, frontend bundle splitting)

  Reference "Technical Assumptions" section for constraints and guidance. Deliver architecture document, API specs (OpenAPI), database
   migration plan, and infrastructure-as-code templates ready for Epic 1 development kickoff.
