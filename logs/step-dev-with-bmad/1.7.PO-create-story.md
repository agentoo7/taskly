‚è∫ I've loaded the task and documents. I need to clarify something important:

  The brownfield-create-story task is designed for small enhancements to existing systems that can be completed in one session.
  However, based on your PRD, this appears to be a greenfield project (building Taskly from scratch) with 5 epics and 29 stories.

  Which story would you like me to create?

  1. Epic 1, Story 1.1 (Project Setup & Development Environment) - The first story in the PRD
  2. A different specific story from the PRD (please specify epic and story number)
  3. A small brownfield enhancement to an existing Taskly system (if this is actually adding to an existing codebase)

  Please clarify so I can create the appropriate story document following the correct template and scope.

  ---
  Note: If you want to create Story 1.1, I can adapt the approach to fit the story template (docs/stories/1.1.project-setup.md) using
  the comprehensive acceptance criteria already defined in your PRD. Just confirm which story you need!

> 1 

‚è∫ Perfect! I'll create Story 1.1 (Project Setup & Development Environment) from Epic 1. Let me break down the comprehensive acceptance
   criteria into actionable tasks and pull relevant technical details from the architecture documents.

  Summary

  Story Overview

  As a developer, I want a fully configured monorepo development environment with Docker Compose, so that I can run the entire
  application stack locally and start building features immediately.

  What's Included

  ‚úÖ 10 Acceptance Criteria (directly from PRD)
  - Monorepo structure, Docker Compose orchestration, hot reload, health checks, documentation, environment config, TypeScript/mypy
  strict mode, linting with pre-commit hooks

  ‚úÖ 8 Major Tasks with 44 Subtasks
  1. Create monorepo structure
  2. Set up frontend (Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
  3. Set up backend (FastAPI with UV, mypy, Ruff, Black)
  4. Configure Docker Compose (PostgreSQL, Redis, hot reload)
  5. Environment configuration (.env.example files)
  6. Documentation (comprehensive README)
  7. Pre-commit hooks (ESLint, Prettier, Ruff, Black, mypy)
  8. Verification and testing

  ‚úÖ Comprehensive Dev Notes (pulled from architecture documents)
  - Backend technical context: Python 3.11.7, FastAPI 0.109.0, PostgreSQL 15.5, Redis 7.2.4, full source structure, health check
  endpoint implementation
  - Frontend technical context: Node.js 20 LTS, Next.js 14.1.0, TypeScript 5.3.3, Tailwind CSS, full source structure
  - Docker Compose configuration reference (ports, volumes, dependencies)
  - Coding standards (Black, Ruff, mypy for backend; Prettier, ESLint for frontend)
  - Testing standards (pytest for backend, Vitest for frontend, 80% coverage target)
  - Database configuration details
  - Pre-commit hook configuration example

  ---
  Next Steps

  The story is now ready for implementation! You can:

  1. Hand off to Dev Agent - Use your /dev command with this story file to begin implementation
  2. Review and Approve - If you want to review or modify the story first, I can help adjust any sections
  3. Create More Stories - I can create additional stories (1.2, 1.3, etc.) from the PRD

  What would you like to do next?

> 3

  Next Steps

  Options:
  1. Start implementing - Begin with Story 1.1 (Project Setup) to build the foundation
  2. Create Epic 4 - Sprint Management (4 stories): Sprint planning, capacity, burndown, velocity
  3. Create Epic 5 - Command Palette (2 stories): Quick actions, keyboard shortcuts
  4. Review existing stories - Validate or modify any created stories before implementation

  Recommendation: You have a solid foundation for MVP implementation. Stories 1.1-3.7 cover all core functionality. Epic 4 and 5 are
  enhancements that can wait until post-MVP.
