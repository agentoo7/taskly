# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 2.1 - Workspace Creation & Management

**Generated:** 2025-10-25
**QA Agent:** Quinn (Test Architect)

---

## Coverage Summary

- **Total Requirements:** 12 Acceptance Criteria
- **Fully Covered:** 1 (8%)
- **Partially Covered:** 1 (8%)
- **Not Covered:** 10 (84%)

### Critical Coverage Gaps

ðŸš¨ **84% of acceptance criteria have NO test coverage**

This represents a **HIGH RISK** to production quality. While the code has been validated through static analysis (linting, type checking), there is minimal automated test coverage to validate functional requirements.

## Critical Gaps Summary

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL Gaps (MUST FIX before production)

1. **AC3**: No test for admin membership creation during workspace creation
2. **AC5**: No test verifying creator assigned ADMIN role
3. **AC8**: Admin-only settings access not tested
4. **AC9**: Admin-only update permission not tested
5. **AC11**: Cascade delete behavior not tested

**Risk:** Authorization vulnerabilities, data integrity issues, critical business logic failures

**Recommended Action:** Implement comprehensive backend integration tests for permission enforcement and cascade delete behavior.

---

### ðŸŸ¡ HIGH Gaps (Should fix before release)

1. **AC2**: Form validation not tested (max 100 chars, required field)
2. **AC10**: Delete confirmation modal safety mechanism not tested

**Risk:** Data validation bypassed, accidental deletions

**Recommended Action:** Add frontend component tests for form validation and modal behavior.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM Gaps (Nice to have)

1. **AC1**: Empty state display not tested
2. **AC4**: Dashboard layout not tested

**Risk:** UI/UX issues, visual regressions

**Recommended Action:** Add basic E2E tests for user journeys.

## Test Design Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities (P0 - Before Production)

#### 1. Backend Service Layer Tests

**File:** `backend/tests/unit/services/test_workspace_service.py`

Priority scenarios:

```python
# P0: Admin membership creation
async def test_create_workspace_adds_creator_as_admin()
    Given: User creating workspace
    When: create_workspace() called
    Then: WorkspaceMember with role=ADMIN created

# P0: Permission enforcement
async def test_update_workspace_requires_admin_role()
    Given: Non-admin member
    When: update_workspace() called
    Then: HTTPException 403 raised

async def test_delete_workspace_requires_admin_role()
    Given: Non-admin member
    When: delete_workspace() called
    Then: HTTPException 403 raised
```

#### 2. Backend Integration Tests

**File:** `backend/tests/integration/test_workspaces_api.py`

Priority scenarios:

```python
# P0: CRUD endpoints
async def test_create_workspace_endpoint()
    Given: Authenticated user
    When: POST /api/workspaces with valid data
    Then: 201 with workspace object, creator is admin

async def test_update_workspace_as_admin_succeeds()
    Given: Admin user
    When: PATCH /api/workspaces/{id}
    Then: 200 with updated workspace

async def test_update_workspace_as_member_fails()
    Given: Non-admin member
    When: PATCH /api/workspaces/{id}
    Then: 403 Forbidden

async def test_delete_workspace_cascades_to_children()
    Given: Workspace with boards and members
    When: DELETE /api/workspaces/{id} by admin
    Then: 204, all related records deleted

async def test_delete_workspace_as_member_fails()
    Given: Non-admin member
    When: DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}
    Then: 403 Forbidden
```

#### 3. Frontend Component Tests

**File:** `frontend/tests/components/workspace/create-workspace-modal.test.tsx`

Priority scenarios:

```typescript
// P0: Form validation
test('validates required workspace name')
    Given: Modal rendered with empty form
    When: Submitting form
    Then: Validation error "Name is required" displayed

test('validates max length 100 characters')
    Given: Modal rendered
    When: Entering 101 characters
    Then: Validation error displayed, submit disabled
```

**File:** `frontend/tests/components/workspace/delete-workspace-modal.test.tsx`

```typescript
// P0: Confirmation safety
test('delete button disabled until name matches exactly')
    Given: Delete modal open for "My Workspace"
    When: User types "my workspace" (wrong case)
    Then: Delete button remains disabled

test('delete button enabled when name matches exactly')
    Given: Delete modal open for "My Workspace"
    When: User types "My Workspace" (exact match)
    Then: Delete button enabled
```

---

### Secondary Priorities (P1 - Before Beta)

#### 4. E2E Tests

**File:** `frontend/tests/e2e/workspace-lifecycle.spec.ts`

```typescript
// P1: Happy path
test('user can create, view, update, and delete workspace')
    Given: Authenticated user on /workspaces
    When: Creating "Test Workspace", navigating to dashboard,
          editing name to "Updated Workspace", deleting workspace
    Then: All operations succeed, user lands back on /workspaces
```

---

### Test Data Requirements

**Fixtures Needed:**

1. `test_user` - Standard authenticated user
2. `test_admin_user` - User with admin role in workspace
3. `test_member_user` - User with member role in workspace
4. `test_workspace` - Workspace with known data
5. `test_workspace_with_boards` - Workspace containing boards/cards for cascade tests

**Mock Requirements:**

1. JWT token generation for auth headers
2. API client configured for integration tests
3. Database session with transaction rollback for isolation

---

### Test Coverage Goals

**Minimum Acceptable Coverage (Before Production):**

- Backend Service Layer: 80% coverage
- Backend API Endpoints: 100% coverage (all routes tested)
- Frontend Components: 60% coverage (critical paths)
- E2E: 3-5 critical user journeys

**Current Coverage:**

- Backend Service Layer: 0%
- Backend API Endpoints: 0%
- Frontend Components: 0%
- E2E: 0%

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas (No Test Coverage)

| Area | Risk | Impact | Probability | Overall |
|------|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Permission enforcement (admin-only actions) | Authorization bypass | HIGH | MEDIUM | **HIGH** |
| Cascade delete behavior | Data integrity loss | HIGH | MEDIUM | **HIGH** |
| Admin membership creation | Missing authorization | HIGH | LOW | **MEDIUM** |
| Form validation (100 char limit) | Data validation bypass | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM** |

### Medium Risk Areas

| Area | Risk | Impact | Probability | Overall |
|------|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Delete confirmation modal | Accidental deletion | MEDIUM | LOW | **MEDIUM** |
| Empty state display | UX confusion | LOW | MEDIUM | **LOW** |

---

## Quality Gate Input

Based on this traceability analysis, the following gate decision factors are identified:

**Blockers:**
- Zero test coverage for critical authorization logic (AC5, AC8, AC9, AC11)
- Zero test coverage for cascade delete behavior (AC11)

**Concerns:**
- No frontend validation tests (AC2)
- No E2E tests for complete workflows

**Recommendations:**
- Implement P0 tests before merging to main/production
- Implement P1 tests before beta release
- Consider this story "functionally complete but test-incomplete"

---

## Traceability Best Practices Applied

âœ… **Every AC mapped to test requirements**
âœ… **Clear Given-When-Then for each test scenario**
âœ… **Coverage gaps identified with severity ratings**
âœ… **Risk-based prioritization (P0, P1)**
âœ… **Actionable test design recommendations**
âœ… **Coverage metrics quantified (8% vs 100% target)**
