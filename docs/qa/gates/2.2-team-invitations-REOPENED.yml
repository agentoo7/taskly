root_cause_analysis:

    - 'Hide workspace settings link for non-admins'
    - 'Disable/hide delete workspace button for non-admins'

gate_decision_rationale: |
  Gate REOPENED and downgraded from PASS to FAIL.

  During production-readiness testing, a CRITICAL security vulnerability was discovered:
  Member role users can perform admin-only operations, completely bypassing the authorization
  model defined in AC 13.

  This is MORE SEVERE than the webhook signature issue that was just fixed because:
  1. Direct impact on data integrity (unauthorized deletes)
  2. Abuse potential (unlimited invitations)
  3. Complete failure of authorization model
  4. Contradicts explicit acceptance criteria

  The webhook security fix (ECDSA signature verification) remains solid and well-implemented.
  However, the permission bypass vulnerability makes the application UNSAFE for production.

  **Production Deployment**: ‚ùå BLOCKED until permission checks are fixed

  Estimated fix time: 4-6 hours (backend checks + frontend UI + tests)

  Once fixed, story can return to PASS status quickly as the infrastructure is solid.

testing_gaps:
  - 'Missing integration test: member_cannot_invite_others'
  - 'Missing integration test: member_cannot_edit_workspace'
  - 'Missing integration test: member_cannot_delete_workspace'
  - 'Missing integration test: admin_can_invite_others'
  - 'E2E test did not catch role-based permission issues'

lessons_learned:
  - 'Need role-based permission testing in E2E tests'
  - 'Backend permission checks must be unit tested'
  - 'Frontend UI restrictions are not sufficient - backend must enforce'
  - 'Production-like testing catches issues missed in development'
