# Story Complexity
story_complexity:
  original_estimate: 13
  revised_estimate: 15
  reason: "Added cleanup job and security improvements"
  breakdown:
    backend_tasks: 9
    frontend_tasks: 4
    integration_tasks: 2

# Next Steps
next_steps:
  for_product_owner:
    - "Review and approve 7 new acceptance criteria (AC 14-20)"
    - "Answer 4 questions about email provider, member limits, re-invitations, analytics"
    - "Approve increased scope from 13 to 15 story points"

  for_dev_team:
    - "Address all 9 P0 critical issues before starting implementation"
    - "Add Task 14 for cleanup job to story file"
    - "Update existing tasks with P0 security improvements"
    - "Review all 87 test scenarios in test design document"
    - "Set up test fixtures and test database"

  for_qa_team:
    - "Prepare test environment with 10K invitation records for performance testing"
    - "Configure email provider mocking for integration tests"
    - "Set up monitoring dashboards for production metrics"
    - "Create test data generators for edge cases"

# Monitoring Requirements (Post-Deployment)
monitoring:
  security_metrics:
    - "Rate limit rejections per workspace per hour (alert if >10 from single IP)"
    - "Email mismatch errors by domain (track common patterns)"
    - "Failed invitation acceptance attempts (alert if spike)"

  performance_metrics:
    - "Invitation query latency (p95 <100ms)"
    - "Member list page load time (p95 <500ms)"
    - "Email sending latency (p95 <5min)"

  data_integrity_metrics:
    - "Workspaces with 0 admins (alert if >0)"
    - "Duplicate workspace memberships (alert if >0)"
    - "Expired invitation count (should trend to 0)"

  business_metrics:
    - "Invitation acceptance rate (alert if <60%)"
    - "Email delivery success rate (alert if <95%)"
    - "Time from invitation to acceptance (median)"

# Summary
summary:
  overall_assessment: "Story has excellent foundation with comprehensive planning, clear acceptance criteria, and complete test coverage. However, 3 critical security/data integrity risks require immediate attention before development can proceed."

  strengths:
    - "Comprehensive 13 acceptance criteria with detailed technical design"
    - "100% requirements traceability (20 ACs → 87 test scenarios)"
    - "Well-structured task breakdown (13 tasks → 15 with QA additions)"
    - "Proper security fundamentals (token generation, expiration, RBAC)"
    - "Good UX considerations (confirmations, error messages, real-time updates)"

  critical_issues:
    - "Rate limiting missing - vulnerable to abuse (SEC-001)"
    - "Last admin can orphan workspace (DATA-001)"
    - "Poor email mismatch UX (SEC-002)"
    - "Missing database indexes (PERF-001)"
    - "No cleanup job (OPS-001)"

  recommendation: "Address all 9 P0 issues before starting development. After fixes, re-assess gate status (expected: CONCERNS → PASS). Story is well-designed and ready for implementation once critical risks are mitigated."

  estimated_timeline:
    fix_p0_issues: "2-3 days"
    implement_story: "8-10 days (15 story points)"
    total_to_production: "10-13 days"
