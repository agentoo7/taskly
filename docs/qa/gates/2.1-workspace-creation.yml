next_steps: |
  PRIORITY ACTIONS (Before Production):
  1. Implement P0 tests (14-16h total) to reach 80% coverage minimum
  2. Add structured logging with correlation IDs (3h) - MANDATORY
  3. Write authorization boundary tests (3h) - HIGH SECURITY RISK
  4. Add rate limiting (2h) - Prevents abuse

  Total effort to PASS gate: ~22-24 hours

  ALTERNATIVE: Request waiver for test coverage if accepting risk of untested code in production.
  NOT RECOMMENDED - authorization and data integrity logic must be tested.

gate_decision_rationale: |
  This story demonstrates excellent code quality in structure, documentation, and
  implementation patterns. The workspace CRUD functionality is well-designed with
  proper separation of concerns, type safety, and security patterns.

  However, the story FAILS quality gate due to CRITICAL gaps in test coverage (8% vs 80%)
  and missing observability (no logging). These gaps create unacceptable risk:

  - Authorization bypass vulnerabilities undetected (admin-only logic untested)
  - Data integrity issues unverified (cascade delete untested)
  - Production debugging impossible (no structured logging)
  - Regression risk on future changes (no safety net)

  The 34 missing tests represent a test debt of ~30 hours to fully address, but the
  P0 subset (14-16h) would bring coverage to acceptable levels for production.

  RECOMMENDATION: Address P0 items before production deployment. Code is production-ready
  from a functional perspective, but lacks the quality engineering required for
  sustainable maintenance.
