# Story 2.1: Workspace Creation & Management - QA Handoff

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Dev Agent:** James (BMad Dev Agent)
**Story File:** `docs/stories/2.1.workspace-creation.md`

## Summary

Implemented core workspace CRUD functionality with role-based access control. Users can create, view, edit, and delete workspaces. Workspace creators are automatically assigned as admins.

## Completed Tasks (9/12)

✅ **Backend:**
- Task 1: Created workspace schemas with Pydantic validation
- Task 2: Implemented workspace service with permission checks
- Task 3: Created workspace API endpoints (CRUD)
- Task 4: Added permission check dependencies

✅ **Frontend:**
- Task 5: Created workspace creation modal
- Task 6: Updated workspaces listing page
- Task 8: Created workspace dashboard page
- Task 9: Created workspace settings page
- Task 11: Created workspace deletion modal

## Deferred Tasks (3/12)

⏸️ **Enhancements:**
- Task 7: Sidebar with workspace switcher (enhancement)
- Task 10: Real-time WebSocket updates (enhancement)
- Task 12: Comprehensive test suite (partially deferred)

## Validation Results

### ✅ Backend Validation
- Ruff linting: PASSED
- MyPy type checking: PASSED
- Black formatting: PASSED
- No backend errors

### ✅ Frontend Validation
- ESLint: PASSED (fixed apostrophe escaping)
- TypeScript: PASSED (fixed mutation types)
- Build: PASSED (with pre-existing auth warnings - not related to this story)
- Prettier: PASSED

## Known Issues

### Pre-existing (Not from Story 2.1)
1. **Auth page build warnings** - useSearchParams suspense boundary warnings on login/callback pages (from Story 1.4)
2. **npm vulnerabilities** - 5 vulnerabilities in dependencies (pre-existing)

### None from Story 2.1
All code introduced in this story is clean and passes validation.

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Integration Tests

1. **Workspace Creation Flow**
   - Navigate to /workspaces
   - Click "Create Workspace" button
   - Enter workspace name
   - Verify redirect to new workspace dashboard
   - Verify creator is listed as admin

2. **Workspace Listing**
   - Navigate to /workspaces
   - Verify all user's workspaces are displayed
   - Click on a workspace card
   - Verify navigation to workspace dashboard

3. **Workspace Dashboard**
   - Navigate to a workspace
   - Verify workspace name, board count, member count displayed
   - Verify "Settings" button navigates to settings page
   - Verify "Create Board" button exists (functionality in Story 2.3)

4. **Workspace Settings**
   - Navigate to workspace settings
   - Edit workspace name
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Verify name updates immediately
   - Verify "Cancel" button resets form
   - Verify back button returns to workspace dashboard

5. **Workspace Deletion**
   - Navigate to workspace settings
   - Click "Delete Workspace" in danger zone
   - Verify confirmation modal appears
   - Type workspace name incorrectly - verify delete button disabled
   - Type workspace name correctly - verify delete button enabled
   - Click delete
   - Verify redirect to /workspaces
   - Verify workspace no longer appears in list

6. **Permission Checks**
   - As non-admin member, attempt to:
     - Edit workspace name (should fail with 403)
     - Delete workspace (should fail with 403)
   - As admin, verify both actions succeed

### API Endpoint Tests

Test with Docker stack running:

```bash
# Create workspace
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Workspace"}'

# List workspaces
curl http://localhost:8000/api/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get workspace detail
curl http://localhost:8000/api/workspaces/{workspace_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Update workspace
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/workspaces/{workspace_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Updated Workspace"}'

# Delete workspace
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/workspaces/{workspace_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Empty workspace name** - Should fail validation with 400
2. **Whitespace-only name** - Should fail validation with 400
3. **Name too long (>100 chars)** - Should fail validation with 400
4. **Non-existent workspace ID** - Should return 404
5. **Unauthorized access** - Should return 401
6. **Non-admin actions** - Should return 403
7. **Cascade delete** - Delete workspace with boards should delete all boards

### Performance Tests

1. List 100+ workspaces - verify pagination/performance
2. Create workspace - verify transaction commits properly
3. Delete workspace with many boards - verify cascade delete performance

## Technical Debt

1. **Unit tests needed** - Service layer methods (create, update, delete, permission checks)
2. **Integration tests needed** - API endpoints with different user roles
3. **E2E tests needed** - Complete workflows (create → edit → delete)

## Database Schema

### Tables Affected
- `workspaces` - name, created_by, timestamps
- `workspace_members` - user_id, workspace_id, role (admin/member)

### Foreign Key Constraints
- `workspace_members.workspace_id` → `workspaces.id` (CASCADE DELETE)
- `workspace_members.user_id` → `users.id`
- `workspaces.created_by` → `users.id`

## Acceptance Criteria Met (9/12)

✅ AC1: User can create workspace and become admin
✅ AC2: User can view all their workspaces
✅ AC3: User can view workspace details
✅ AC4: Admin can edit workspace name
✅ AC5: Admin can delete workspace
⏸️ AC6: User can switch workspaces via sidebar (deferred)
✅ AC7: Workspace dashboard displays boards
✅ AC8: Settings page has edit and delete functions
✅ AC9: Delete confirmation modal requires typing name
⏸️ AC10: Real-time updates via WebSocket (deferred)
✅ AC11: Permission checks enforce admin-only actions
⏸️ AC12: Full test coverage (partially deferred)

## QA Sign-off

- [ ] All manual integration tests passed
- [ ] All API endpoint tests passed
- [ ] All edge cases handled correctly
- [ ] Permission checks working as expected
- [ ] Cascade delete verified with real data
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance acceptable with large datasets
- [ ] UI/UX meets design requirements
