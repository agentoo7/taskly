# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Please create detailed UI/UX design specifications for Taskly based on this PRD. Focus on:

**1. Visual Design System**
- Color palette (primary: GitHub blue #0366D6, status colors: green/yellow/red/purple, neutral grays)
- Typography (monospace for code/IDs: Fira Code/JetBrains Mono; sans-serif for UI: Inter/system-ui)
- Iconography (Heroicons/Lucide with 2px stroke, GitHub Octicons for Git indicators)
- Spacing grid (8px system)
- Dark mode implementation

**2. Core Screen Wireframes/Mockups**
- Kanban Board View (drag-and-drop, card states, inline PR status)
- Timeline View (horizontal sprints, capacity bars, card compaction)
- Card Detail Modal (markdown editor, PR summary, activity timeline, comments)
- Command Palette (⌘+K overlay, fuzzy search, keyboard navigation)
- Workspace Dashboard (board grid, empty states)
- Onboarding Flow (multi-step wizard: workspace → GitHub connect → board → first card)

**3. Interaction Patterns**
- Drag-and-drop behavior (@dnd-kit library, ghost previews, drop zones)
- Keyboard shortcuts (J/K navigation, C create, E edit, V view switch)
- Hover states (contextual actions on cards/columns)
- Animations (200ms standard, 300ms complex, optimistic UI updates)
- Real-time collaboration indicators (presence, live updates)

**4. Responsive Layouts**
- Desktop (1280px+): full multi-column Kanban, horizontal timeline
- Tablet (768-1024px): condensed columns, touch-optimized drag
- Mobile (<768px): single-column fallback, read-only message for timeline

**5. Accessibility Compliance (WCAG AA)**
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
- Focus indicators (visible outlines)
- Color contrast (4.5:1 minimum for text)
- No color-only information (icons + color for status)

**Deliverables:**
- Design system documentation (Markdown + Figma/Sketch)
- High-fidelity mockups for 8 core screens
- Interactive prototype (optional but recommended for drag-and-drop)
- Component library specifications (for shadcn/ui customization)
- Accessibility audit checklist

## Architect Prompt

Please create comprehensive technical architecture documentation for Taskly based on this PRD. Focus on:

**1. Database Architecture**
- Complete ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) with all tables, columns, data types, constraints
- Tables: users, workspaces, workspace_members, boards, cards, card_assignees, card_comments, card_activity, sprints, labels, git_repositories, pull_requests, card_pull_requests
- Indexes strategy (B-tree on FKs, GIN on JSONB, full-text search indexes)
- JSONB schema for flexible metadata (cards.metadata, boards.columns, pull_requests.ci_status)
- Migration plan (Alembic migrations mapped to stories requiring schema changes)

**2. API Specifications**
- RESTful API endpoints (full OpenAPI 3.0 specification)
  - Authentication: POST /auth/github/callback, POST /auth/refresh, POST /auth/logout
  - Workspaces: GET/POST /workspaces, GET/PATCH/DELETE /workspaces/{id}, POST /workspaces/{id}/invite
  - Boards: GET/POST /boards, GET/PATCH/DELETE /boards/{id}
  - Cards: GET/POST /cards, GET/PATCH/DELETE /cards/{id}, POST /cards/bulk-update
  - Git: GET /git/repositories, POST /git/repositories/connect, POST /cards/{id}/create-branch
  - Webhooks: POST /webhooks/github
- Request/response schemas (Pydantic models)
- Error response formats (consistent error codes, messages)
- Authentication flow (JWT access + refresh tokens, middleware)
- Rate limiting strategy (per-user, per-IP, Redis-backed)

**3. WebSocket Architecture**
- Real-time event specifications (message formats, event types)
- Events: card_moved, card_updated, pr_updated, card_sprint_changed
- Connection lifecycle (authentication, heartbeat, reconnection)
- Scalability approach (Redis pub/sub for multi-instance sync)
- Fallback to polling (graceful degradation)

**4. Background Job Architecture (Celery)**
- Task definitions and priorities
  - Git operations (branch creation, webhook processing) - high priority
  - Bulk updates (batch card changes) - medium priority
  - Email notifications - low priority
- Retry logic (exponential backoff: 5s, 25s, 125s)
- Dead letter queue for failed tasks
- Task monitoring (Flower dashboard)

**5. GitHub Integration Architecture**
- OAuth 2.0 flow (authorization, token exchange, refresh)
- API client design (httpx async client, retry middleware, rate limit handling)
- Webhook handler architecture
  - Signature validation (HMAC SHA-256)
  - Event routing (pull_request, pull_request_review, status, check_suite, push)
  - Idempotency handling (event_id deduplication)
- Rate limit management (5000 req/hour per user, caching strategy, webhook-first approach)

**6. Deployment Architecture**
- Docker Compose services (Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery worker)
- Multi-stage Dockerfile builds (optimized image sizes)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions: lint → test → build → deploy)
- Environment configuration (dev, staging, production)
- Infrastructure diagram (AWS/GCP/DigitalOcean managed services)
- Secrets management (environment variables, cloud secrets manager)

**7. Security Architecture**
- Authentication flow diagram (GitHub OAuth → JWT issuance → token refresh)
- Authorization model (workspace-level RBAC: admin vs member)
- Data encryption (at-rest: PostgreSQL encryption, in-transit: TLS 1.3)
- GitHub token security (encrypted storage, never logged)
- Input validation (Pydantic schemas, SQL injection prevention)
- CORS configuration (allowed origins)

**8. Performance Optimizations**
- Frontend: code splitting (route-based chunks), lazy loading (images, below-fold), bundle size target (<500KB gzipped)
- Backend: query optimization (eager loading, N+1 prevention), database connection pooling
- Caching strategy: Redis for sessions/boards (5 min TTL), frontend caching (React Query)
- Virtualization for large boards (500+ cards, only render visible)

**9. Monitoring & Observability**
- Error tracking (Sentry integration)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus/Datadog: API latency, Git operation success rate, queue depth)
- Structured logging (JSON logs with correlation IDs)
- Uptime monitoring (external health checks)

**Deliverables:**
- Architecture document (Markdown with diagrams)
- Database schema SQL (CREATE TABLE statements + indexes)
- OpenAPI specification (YAML/JSON for API docs)
- Docker Compose configuration (production-ready)
- Infrastructure-as-code templates (Terraform or CloudFormation, optional)
- Alembic migration plan (mapping migrations to epic/story delivery)

**PRD Status:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

This document is now ready for handoff to UX Expert (design phase) and Technical Architect (architecture phase). Both workstreams can proceed in parallel during Epic 1 development.
