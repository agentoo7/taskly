# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Eliminate wasted developer time by synchronizing visual task boards with Git repositories
- Preserve task-to-code context automatically to prevent reviewer context loss and costly rework cycles
- Provide Trello-simple visual management with automated Git workflow capabilities
- Enable real-time bidirectional sync where board actions trigger Git operations and code activity updates cards
- Deliver multi-view project intelligence (Kanban, Timeline) for both developers and engineering managers
- Establish Taskly as the Git-native project management solution ("Move a Card, Ship the Code")

## Background Context

Software development teams today operate in fragmented workflows where task management (Trello, Jira, Linear) exists separately from code development (GitHub, GitLab). This fragmentation creates a "double-entry tax" where developers manually update both the project board and Git repositories, wasting 5-10 hours per week per developer. More critically, when reviewers open pull requests, they lack immediate access to original requirements, acceptance criteria, and design decisions—leading to context loss that causes misaligned code and preventable rework cycles.

Taskly solves this by treating the project board as a "control surface for your repo"—where moving a card automatically triggers Git operations (branch creation, PR setup) and code activity (commits, CI runs, merges) updates card status in real-time. By maintaining bidirectional synchronization between tasks and code, Taskly ensures every PR is linked to its requirement, eliminates manual status updates, and preserves complete task-to-code traceability. The target market is software development teams (5-50 developers) using GitHub alongside traditional project management tools who struggle with context switching and synchronization overhead.
