# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall provide a Kanban board with drag-and-drop card management across customizable columns (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done).

**FR2:** Each card shall support comprehensive metadata including title, description (markdown), acceptance criteria (markdown), assignees (one or multiple), priority (Low/Medium/High/Urgent), labels/tags, story points, sprint assignment, due dates, comments, and activity timeline.

**FR3:** The system shall connect to GitHub organizations and repositories via OAuth 2.0 authentication.

**FR4:** Each card shall support linking to one or more GitHub issues or pull requests via manual URL entry or auto-detection when branch/PR references the card ID.

**FR5:** Cards linked to PRs shall display PR status (draft/ready/approved/merged), associated commits, and CI status inline within the card interface.

**FR6:** When a user moves a card to "In Progress," the system shall offer one-click branch creation with configurable naming conventions (e.g., `feature/TASK-123-brief-description`).

**FR7:** When a linked PR's state changes in GitHub (status updates, approvals, CI results), the system shall automatically update the corresponding card status within 1 second.

**FR8:** When a linked PR is merged in GitHub, the system shall optionally auto-move the corresponding card to "Done" based on user preference.

**FR9:** The system shall provide a Timeline view displaying sprints/iterations horizontally with cards grouped by sprint and story point totals visible.

**FR10:** Users shall be able to drag cards between sprints in Timeline view to rebalance workload.

**FR11:** The Timeline view shall display visual capacity indicators showing overloaded vs. balanced sprint allocation.

**FR12:** The system shall provide a keyboard-first command palette (âŒ˜+K or Ctrl+K) enabling quick actions including create card, search, assign, change status, and navigate views.

**FR13:** The system shall support keyboard navigation shortcuts including J/K for card navigation, C for create card, and E for edit card.

**FR14:** Users shall be able to create workspaces and invite team members via email invitation.

**FR15:** The system shall support basic role permissions with two levels: admin (full access) and member (standard access).

**FR16:** Each workspace shall support multiple boards for organizing different projects or workflows.

**FR17:** Users shall be able to multi-select cards using shift-click or checkbox selection.

**FR18:** The system shall support batch operations on selected cards including assign multiple assignees, add labels, change priority, and move to column.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** Page load time shall be less than 1 second for cached loads and less than 2 seconds for cold starts.

**NFR2:** View transitions between Kanban, Timeline, and other views shall complete in less than 500 milliseconds.

**NFR3:** Git operations (branch creation, PR linking) shall complete within 3 seconds from user action initiation.

**NFR4:** Real-time updates triggered by webhooks shall reflect in the user interface within 1 second of the webhook event.

**NFR5:** The system shall support 100+ concurrent users per workspace without performance degradation.

**NFR6:** The application shall support modern browsers only: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+ (no IE11 support).

**NFR7:** The user interface shall be desktop-first with responsive design supporting tablet devices.

**NFR8:** All communications shall use HTTPS with TLS 1.3 encryption.

**NFR9:** Authentication shall use JWT tokens with 15-minute access token expiration and 7-day refresh token expiration.

**NFR10:** The API shall implement rate limiting on both per-user and per-IP basis to prevent abuse.

**NFR11:** The system shall comply with GDPR requirements including user data export and right to deletion capabilities.

**NFR12:** GitHub API rate limits (5000 requests/hour per authenticated user) shall be managed through aggressive caching and webhook-based updates instead of polling.
