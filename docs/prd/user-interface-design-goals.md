# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Taskly embraces a "developer-first, zero-friction" UX philosophy that prioritizes speed, clarity, and keyboard-driven workflows. The interface should feel as fast and responsive as a native desktop application while maintaining the visual simplicity that made Trello beloved. Every interaction—dragging cards, switching views, opening modals—must complete in under 500ms with optimistic UI updates to eliminate perceived lag. The design balances information density (showing PR status, CI indicators, metadata inline) with visual breathing room, ensuring developers can scan boards quickly without cognitive overload. Dark mode support is essential given the developer audience.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

1. **Keyboard-First Navigation:** Power users should rarely need a mouse. ⌘+K command palette for all major actions, J/K for card navigation, arrow keys for moving focus, Enter to open, Escape to close.

2. **Drag-and-Drop as Primary Manipulation:** Cards move between columns via drag-and-drop (with keyboard alternatives). Multi-select with Shift+Click or lasso selection enables batch operations.

3. **Contextual Inline Actions:** Hover states reveal quick actions (assign, label, link PR) without opening modals. Only complex operations (edit full description, configure settings) require modal dialogs.

4. **Real-Time Collaboration Indicators:** Subtle presence indicators show who's viewing/editing cards. Changes from other users appear instantly with brief animation to draw attention without disrupting focus.

5. **Progressive Disclosure:** Cards show summary view by default (title, assignee, priority, PR status). Click to expand inline for full description, comments, and activity timeline. This keeps the board scannable while providing depth on demand.

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

1. **Kanban Board View** - Primary daily workspace for managing task flow
2. **Timeline View (Sprint Planning)** - Horizontal timeline for workload balancing and sprint management
3. **Card Detail Modal/Panel** - Expanded view showing full description, acceptance criteria, comments, linked PRs/commits, activity timeline
4. **Workspace Dashboard** - Landing page after login showing all boards in workspace with quick access
5. **Board Settings** - Configure columns, naming conventions for branches, GitHub repo connections, automation rules
6. **Workspace Settings** - Manage team members, permissions, integrations (GitHub OAuth)
7. **Onboarding Flow** - Multi-step wizard: Create workspace → Connect GitHub → Create first board → Link first card to PR
8. **Command Palette (⌘+K)** - Global search and action interface overlaying any screen

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Target WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance to ensure usability for developers with visual, motor, or cognitive disabilities. Specific requirements:
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Minimum 4.5:1 color contrast ratios for text
- Focus indicators clearly visible on all interactive elements
- No reliance on color alone to convey information (use icons + color for status)

## Branding

**Visual Style:** Clean, modern, professional aesthetic inspired by developer tools (GitHub, Linear, Vercel dashboards) rather than consumer productivity apps. Emphasis on typography hierarchy, generous whitespace, and functional design over decorative elements.

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: GitHub-inspired deep blue (#0366D6) for CTAs and active states
- Neutral grays for backgrounds and text (light mode: #F6F8FA background, dark mode: #0D1117 background)
- Status colors: Green (success/merged), Yellow (in progress/pending), Red (failed/blocked), Purple (in review)
- All colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements

**Typography:** Monospace font (Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, or SF Mono) for code references, card IDs, and branch names. Sans-serif (Inter, system-ui) for body text and UI elements.

**Iconography:** Minimal, line-based icons (Heroicons or Lucide) with 2px stroke weight. GitHub's Octicons for Git-specific indicators (branch, PR, commit).

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary:** Desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge 90+) optimized for screen sizes 1280x720 and above. Layout assumes horizontal space for multi-column Kanban boards and Timeline views.

**Secondary:** Tablet devices (iPad, Android tablets) in landscape orientation with touch-optimized drag-and-drop. Portrait orientation shows single-column mobile-friendly layout with reduced feature set.

**Out of Scope for MVP:** Native mobile apps (iOS/Android), though the responsive web app should be usable on mobile browsers for quick status checks or comment replies.

**Target OS:** Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) via web browsers—no OS-specific features or native desktop wrappers.
