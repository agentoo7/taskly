# Epic 2: Core Board & Card Management

**Expanded Goal:** Enable users to create workspaces, invite team members, and manage visual Kanban boards with rich card metadata. This epic delivers the core project management experience with drag-and-drop card manipulation, comprehensive metadata support (assignees, labels, priorities, story points, due dates), card comments, and activity tracking. By the end of this epic, Taskly functions as a complete standalone project management tool comparable to Trello, providing immediate value even without Git integration.

## Story 2.1: Workspace Creation & Management

**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to create and manage workspaces for my teams,
**so that** I can organize multiple projects separately.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Landing page displays "Create Workspace" button when user has no workspaces
2. Clicking "Create Workspace" opens modal with form: workspace name (required, max 100 chars)
3. Submitting form creates workspace with current user as admin and redirects to workspace dashboard
4. Workspace dashboard displays workspace name, list of boards (empty initially), "Create Board" button
5. User who created workspace automatically assigned "admin" role in workspace_members table
6. Sidebar navigation shows list of all workspaces user is member of with ability to switch between them
7. Active workspace indicated visually in sidebar (highlighted, checkmark, or bold text)
8. Workspace settings page accessible to admins showing: workspace name (editable), member list, delete workspace option
9. Workspace name editable by admins only (updates in real-time for all members viewing workspace)
10. Delete workspace action requires confirmation modal ("This will delete all boards and cards. Type workspace name to confirm")
11. Deleting workspace cascades deletion to all boards, cards, and membership records
12. Workspace dashboard shows empty state with helpful message and call-to-action when no boards exist: "Get started by creating your first board"

## Story 2.2: Team Member Invitations & Permissions

2. Clicking button opens invite modal with email input field (supports multiple comma-separated emails)
3. Role selector dropdown offers two options: "Member" (default), "Admin"
4. Submitting invitation sends email to each address with invite link containing secure token

9. Admins can change member roles via dropdown in member list (member â†” admin)
10. Admins can remove members from workspace (requires confirmation: "Remove [username] from workspace?")
11. Removed members lose access immediately; attempting to access workspace shows 403 error with message "You are no longer a member of this workspace"
12. Invite tokens expire after 7 days; expired links show error message "Invite expired. Please request a new invitation."
13. Members (non-admin role) can view workspace and boards but cannot invite others, change permissions, or delete workspace

## Story 2.3: Board Creation & Column Customization

15. Archived boards hidden from main board list but accessible via "Show Archived" toggle in workspace dashboard
16. Deleting board requires confirmation and cascades deletion to all cards

## Story 2.4: Card Creation & Basic Metadata

**As a** board member,
**I want** to create cards with title, description, and basic metadata,
**so that** I can capture and organize tasks.

### Acceptance Criteria

12. Cards within column ordered by position ascending (lowest position at top)
13. Empty columns display placeholder text: "Drag cards here or click + to add"
14. Card detail modal includes "Delete Card" button (requires confirmation: "Delete this card?")

## Story 2.5: Drag-and-Drop Card Movement

**As a** board member,
**I want** to drag cards between columns and reorder them within columns,
**so that** I can visualize workflow progress.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Cards draggable by clicking and holding anywhere on card surface (cursor changes to grab icon)
2. Dragging card displays ghost preview following cursor and semi-transparent placeholder in original position
3. Hovering over target column highlights drop zone with visual indicator (border or background color change)
4. Dropping card in new column moves card and updates `cards.column_id` field in database
5. Dropping card between existing cards reorders position; dropping at top/bottom places card at start/end of column
6. Card position recalculated on drop: target position set to dropped location, other cards in column reordered accordingly
7. Drag-and-drop works with @dnd-kit library (accessible, keyboard-navigable)
8. Keyboard alternative: focus card with Tab, press Space to "pick up," arrow keys to move, Space again to "drop," Escape to cancel
9. Dropping card triggers optimistic UI update (card moves immediately) followed by API request; rollback if API fails
10. Moving card updates `cards.updated_at` timestamp and creates activity log entry: "[User] moved card from [Old Column] to [New Column]"
11. Multiple users dragging cards simultaneously see real-time updates via WebSocket (other users' drag operations visible with different colored ghost preview)
12. Dragging disabled for cards being edited by another user (lock indicator displayed)
13. Long columns (50+ cards) virtualized for performance (only render visible cards, scroll smoothly)
14. Mobile/touch devices support drag-and-drop via long-press gesture (hold 500ms to activate drag mode)

## Story 2.6: Advanced Card Metadata (Assignees & Labels)

11. Adding label to card displays label chip (colored rectangle with label name) in card detail and column view
12. Multiple labels per card supported; labels displayed horizontally in card detail, vertically stacked in column view (max 3 visible)
13. Labels stored in `cards.metadata` JSONB field as array: `labels: [{id: uuid, name: string, color: string}]`
14. Assignees stored via many-to-many relationship table: `card_assignees(card_id, user_id, assigned_at)`
15. Filtering controls in board header allow filtering by: assignee (dropdown multi-select), label (dropdown multi-select), priority
16. Applying filters hides cards not matching criteria; filter badge displays active filter count (e.g., "3 filters active")
17. Clear all filters button resets board to show all cards
