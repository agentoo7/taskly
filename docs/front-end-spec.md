# Taskly UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Taskly's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

The specification is informed by the Product Requirements Document and focuses on delivering a "developer-first, zero-friction" UX philosophy that prioritizes speed, clarity, and keyboard-driven workflows. Taskly bridges project management and code development, transforming traditional boards into a Git-native "control surface for your repo."

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

1. **Developer (Primary):** Software engineers (IC levels) who need fast task-to-code workflows. They value keyboard shortcuts, GitHub integration, and minimal context switching. Success = moving from card to PR in <30 seconds.

2. **Engineering Manager (Secondary):** Tech leads and engineering managers who need sprint planning and team capacity visibility. They value Timeline view, workload balancing, and progress tracking. Success = planning 2-week sprint in <15 minutes.

3. **Product/Project Manager (Tertiary):** PMs who collaborate with dev teams and need to track feature status linked to code. They value card metadata, filtering, and real-time PR status. Success = understanding "what shipped" without asking developers.

#### Usability Goals

- **Ease of learning:** New developers can create their first card and link it to a PR within 5 minutes of onboarding
- **Efficiency of use:** Power users can navigate entire board, create cards, and move between views using only keyboard (zero mouse dependency)
- **Git operation speed:** Branch creation from card completes in <3 seconds; PR status updates appear in <1 second via webhooks
- **Minimal cognitive load:** Card status (In Progress, PR status, CI results) visible at a glance without opening details
- **Error prevention:** Destructive actions (delete card, disconnect repo, delete workspace) require explicit confirmation with typed verification for critical operations

#### Design Principles

1. **Speed Above All** - Every interaction must complete in <500ms with optimistic UI updates. Perceived performance matters more than technical benchmarks.

2. **Keyboard-First, Mouse-Optional** - Power users should accomplish 95% of tasks via keyboard. Command palette (⌘+K) is the primary interface for experienced users.

3. **Context Preservation** - Never force users to leave Taskly to understand task state. PR status, commits, CI results visible inline on cards.

4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Cards show summary by default (title, assignee, PR badge); expand inline for full context. Balance information density with visual calm.

5. **GitHub-Native Integration** - Git operations (branch creation, PR linking, webhooks) should feel like native Taskly features, not "integrations."

```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation (Top Bar - Always Visible):**
- Left: Taskly logo (returns to Workspace Dashboard)
- Center: Current workspace name (dropdown to switch workspaces)
- Right: Command palette trigger (⌘+K badge visible), User avatar (dropdown: Profile, Settings, Logout)

**Secondary Navigation (Board Context):**
- Board header bar:
  - Left: Board name (inline editable), Star/favorite toggle
  - Center: View toggle buttons (Kanban | Timeline), Active sprint indicator (for Timeline view)
  - Right: Filter controls (Assignee, Label, Priority dropdowns), Search input, Board settings gear icon

**Breadcrumb Strategy:**
- **Workspace Dashboard:** No breadcrumb (top level)
- **Board Views:** `Workspace Name > Board Name` (both clickable)
- **Card Detail Modal:** Overlays current view, shows card ID + title in modal header, no breadcrumb change
- **Settings Pages:** `Workspace Name > Settings` or `Board Name > Board Settings`
- Breadcrumbs remain persistent in top bar even when modals open (provides context anchoring)

**Contextual Navigation (Modal/Overlay):**
- **Command Palette (⌘+K):** Global overlay accessible from anywhere, keyboard-driven navigation
- **Card Detail:** Modal overlay with tabs (Details | Activity | Linked PRs), close via Escape or X button
- **Onboarding Wizard:** Full-screen takeover with step indicators (1/4, 2/4, etc.), Skip option in top-right

**Mobile/Tablet Adaptation:**
- Tablet (768-1024px): Primary nav collapses workspace dropdown to icon, secondary nav shows only View toggle + Search (other controls in overflow menu)
- Mobile (<768px): Simplified nav with hamburger menu, no command palette (touch-optimized alternatives)

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Complete Task Workflow (Card to Merged PR)

**User Goal:** Move a development task from idea to deployed code with automated synchronization

**Entry Points:**
- Kanban board "To Do" column
- Command palette: ⌘+K → "Create Card"
- Quick-create button in any column header

**Success Criteria:**
- Card automatically moves to "Done" when PR merges
- All Git activity visible on card without leaving Taskly
- Zero manual status updates required

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User creates card in To Do] --> B[User fills title, description, acceptance criteria]
    B --> C[User drags card to In Progress]
    C --> D{Branch already exists?}

    D -->|No| E[User clicks Create Branch button]
    E --> F[System generates branch name: feature/CARD-123-title]
    F --> G[User confirms/edits branch name]
    G --> H[Backend creates branch via GitHub API]
    H --> I[Success: Branch link displayed on card]

    D -->|Yes| J[User links existing PR via URL]

    I --> K[User codes in local environment]
    J --> K

    K --> L[User commits & pushes to branch]
    L --> M[User creates PR on GitHub]
    M --> N[Webhook: PR opened detected]
    N --> O[Card auto-linked via branch name pattern]
    O --> P[PR status displayed on card: Draft/Open]

    P --> Q[CI runs, webhook updates card]
    Q --> R{CI Passed?}
    R -->|No| S[Card shows red X, failed checks]
    S --> T[Developer fixes, pushes again]
    T --> Q

    R -->|Yes| U[Card shows green checkmark]
    U --> V[Reviewer approves PR]
    V --> W[PR merged on GitHub]
    W --> X[Webhook: PR merged detected]
    X --> Y[Backend auto-moves card to Done]
    Y --> Z[Card animates to Done column in real-time]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- **Branch name conflict:** Show error "Branch already exists", suggest alternative name with -v2 suffix, offer link to existing branch
- **GitHub API timeout:** Show loading state for max 5s, then error toast "Couldn't create branch. Retry or create manually." with copy-branch-name button
- **PR auto-link fails:** User can manually link PR via "+ Link Pull Request" button, system learns pattern for future auto-detection
- **Multiple linked PRs:** Card only auto-moves when ALL linked PRs are merged (configurable: "any" vs "all" in board settings)
- **User removed from workspace:** Webhook-triggered auto-move uses system actor "[GitHub]" to bypass permission checks

**Notes:** This is the "golden path" that validates Taskly's core value proposition. Every optimization here (branch creation speed, webhook latency, real-time updates) directly impacts user satisfaction. Target: complete this flow 10x/day per developer without friction.

### Flow 2: Sprint Planning Session (Manager Persona)

**User Goal:** Plan upcoming 2-week sprint by assigning cards from backlog and balancing team capacity

**Entry Points:**
- Board header → Switch to Timeline view
- Command palette: ⌘+K → "Switch to Timeline View"

**Success Criteria:**
- Sprint reaches 80-100% capacity without overload
- All team members have balanced workload
- Cards assigned with clear prioritization

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Manager clicks Timeline view toggle] --> B[System loads Timeline with sprints + backlog]
    B --> C[Manager enables Planning Mode toggle]
    C --> D[UI switches to wide backlog + sprint columns]

    D --> E[Manager reviews Sprint 3 capacity: 15/40 pts]
    E --> F[Manager clicks card in backlog]
    F --> G{Single or multi-select?}

    G -->|Single| H[Drag card to Sprint 3 column]
    G -->|Multi-select| I[Shift+click multiple cards]
    I --> J[Click Assign to Sprint button]
    J --> K[Select Sprint 3 from dropdown]

    H --> L[Capacity bar updates: 20/40 pts]
    K --> L

    L --> M{Capacity OK?}
    M -->|<100%| N[Continue adding cards]
    M -->|>100%| O[Warning badge: Sprint Overloaded]
    O --> P[Manager removes cards or adjusts capacity]

    N --> Q[Manager checks assignee distribution]
    Q --> R{Any team member >100%?}
    R -->|Yes| S[Red dot on assignee avatar]
    S --> T[Manager reassigns cards to balance]
    R -->|No| U[Sprint health: Balanced]

    T --> U
    U --> V[Manager reviews next sprint]
    V --> W[Repeat for Sprint 4, 5...]
    W --> X[Exit Planning Mode]
    X --> Y[Return to normal Timeline view]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- **Empty backlog:** Show empty state "All caught up! No unplanned cards." with "Create Card" button
- **No sprints defined:** Timeline shows only backlog column + tooltip "Create your first sprint in Board Settings"
- **Over-capacity drag attempt:** Show confirmation modal "Sprint 3 is overloaded (45/40 pts). Add 3 cards anyway?" with Yes/Cancel
- **Bulk assign to full sprint:** System adds all cards but displays warning "Sprint 3 now overloaded (+15 pts over capacity)"
- **Undo accidental bulk move:** Ctrl+Z immediately reverts sprint assignment for last action (session-based undo stack)

**Notes:** Timeline view differentiates Taskly from Trello/Linear. Capacity indicators (color-coded bars, health scores) must be instantly scannable. Target: plan full sprint in <15 minutes vs. 30-45 minutes in spreadsheet/manual board updates.

### Flow 3: Onboarding New User (First-Time Experience)

**User Goal:** Go from signup to first linked PR in <10 minutes

**Entry Points:**
- Marketing site "Get Started" CTA
- Direct signup URL

**Success Criteria:**
- User completes: GitHub auth → workspace created → repository connected → board created → first card linked to PR
- User understands Taskly's core value (Git synchronization)
- Zero drop-off during critical steps

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Landing page: Sign in with GitHub button] --> B[GitHub OAuth authorization screen]
    B --> C{User approves?}
    C -->|No| D[Return to landing page: error message]
    C -->|Yes| E[Redirect back to Taskly with auth code]

    E --> F[Backend exchanges code for token]
    F --> G[Create user record in database]
    G --> H[Onboarding Wizard: Step 1 of 4]

    H --> I[Prompt: Create your workspace name]
    I --> J[User enters Acme Engineering]
    J --> K[Step 2: Connect GitHub Repository]

    K --> L[Show list of user's accessible repos]
    L --> M[User searches and selects acme/web-app]
    M --> N[System stores repo connection]
    N --> O[Step 3: Create your first board]

    O --> P[Prompt: Board name + template selector]
    P --> Q[User selects Default Kanban template]
    Q --> R[Board created with To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done]
    R --> S[Step 4: Create your first card]

    S --> T[Inline tutorial highlights To Do column]
    T --> U[User clicks + Add Card]
    U --> V[User types: Implement user authentication]
    V --> W[Card created, detail modal opens]

    W --> X[Tooltip: Link this card to a PR or create a branch]
    X --> Y{User has existing PR?}
    Y -->|Yes| Z1[User pastes PR URL]
    Z1 --> Z2[PR auto-linked, status displayed]
    Y -->|No| Z3[User clicks Create Branch]
    Z3 --> Z4[Branch created: feature/CARD-1-implement-user-auth]

    Z2 --> AA[Success! Tutorial complete banner]
    Z4 --> AA
    AA --> AB[Redirect to Kanban board]
    AB --> AC[Optional: Show keyboard shortcuts tooltip]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- **GitHub auth denied:** Show message "GitHub authorization required to use Taskly" with "Try Again" button
- **No accessible repos:** Show message "No repositories found. Make sure you've granted Taskly access to your repos." with "Reconnect GitHub" button
- **Workspace name taken:** Inline validation: "Workspace name already exists, try another"
- **User exits wizard early:** Show "Resume setup" banner on next login, allow skip to partial state (e.g., workspace created but no board)
- **Slow GitHub API:** Show skeleton loaders for repo list, timeout after 10s with "Having trouble loading repos. Continue anyway?" option

**Notes:** First impression critical. Each step must feel instant (<500ms transitions). Celebrate small wins (confetti on board creation, success checkmark on PR link). Skip button available after Step 2 for experienced users who want to explore first.

### Flow 4: Command Palette Power User Workflow

**User Goal:** Accomplish common tasks without touching mouse using keyboard shortcuts

**Entry Points:**
- Any screen: Press ⌘+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux)

**Success Criteria:**
- User navigates to any screen, creates cards, switches views, and performs bulk actions entirely via keyboard
- Command palette responds in <100ms

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User presses ⌘+K] --> B[Command palette opens, search input focused]
    B --> C[User types: cre card]
    C --> D[Fuzzy match: Create Card command highlighted]
    D --> E[User presses Enter]
    E --> F[Palette shows: Which column?]

    F --> G[User types: prog]
    G --> H[Fuzzy match: In Progress column]
    H --> I[User presses Enter]
    I --> J[Quick-create input appears in In Progress column]
    J --> K[User types card title, presses Enter]
    K --> L[Card created]

    L --> M[User presses ⌘+K again]
    M --> N[User types: timeline]
    N --> O[Match: Switch to Timeline View]
    O --> P[User presses Enter]
    P --> Q[View switches to Timeline in <500ms]

    Q --> R[User presses ⌘+K]
    R --> S[User types: #auth]
    S --> T[# prefix triggers card search mode]
    T --> U[Shows cards matching authentication]
    U --> V[User presses ↓ to select, Enter to open]
    V --> W[Card detail modal opens]

    W --> X[User makes changes, presses Escape]
    X --> Y[Modal closes, back to Timeline view]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- **No fuzzy match found:** Show "No commands found. Try different keywords or press ? for help"
- **Command disabled in current context:** Show grayed-out command with tooltip "Not available in Timeline view"
- **Recent commands empty:** Section hidden until user executes first command
- **Keyboard shortcut conflict:** Settings page shows warning "Shortcut ⌘+B already assigned to Bold. Reassign?" when user tries to customize
- **Slow search (>100ms):** Debounce at 150ms, show spinner only if search takes >300ms

**Notes:** Command palette is Taskly's "superpower" for developers. Must feel as fast as Spotlight/Alfred. Recent commands list (5 most recent) accelerates repeated actions. Card search mode (#) eliminates need for visual scanning on large boards.

## Component Library / Design System

### Design System Approach

**Strategy:** Customize shadcn/ui component library (built on Radix UI primitives) rather than build from scratch

**Rationale:**
- **shadcn/ui** provides accessible, composable React components that copy directly into your codebase (not npm dependency)
- Built on **Radix UI** primitives ensuring WCAG AA compliance by default (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, focus management)
- **Tailwind CSS** utility-first styling allows rapid customization without component library lock-in
- Developer-friendly: Components are editable TypeScript files in `/components/ui`, not black boxes

**Customization Layers:**
1. **Theme Tokens (Tailwind config):** Custom color palette, typography scale, spacing system
2. **Base Components (shadcn/ui):** Button, Input, Select, Dialog, Popover, etc. - copy from shadcn/ui and customize
3. **Composite Components (Taskly-specific):** Card, ColumnHeader, SprintColumn, CapacityBar - built from base components
4. **Layout Components:** BoardGrid, TimelineContainer, ModalLayout - structural wrappers

**Design System Documentation:**
- Storybook for component catalog (browse, interact, view code)
- Figma Component Library (synced naming with code components for designer-developer handoff)
- Accessibility test results per component (aXe audit scores)

### Core Components

#### Component 1: Button

**Purpose:** Primary interaction element for all actions (CTAs, form submissions, navigation)

**Variants:** Primary (solid GitHub blue), Secondary (outline gray), Ghost (transparent), Destructive (red)

**States:** Default, Hover, Active, Focus (blue ring), Disabled (50% opacity), Loading (spinner)

**Sizes:** Small (32px), Medium (40px), Large (48px)

**Usage Guidelines:** One Primary per screen section, Destructive for irreversible actions with confirmation, Ghost for tight spaces, always provide loading state for async operations

#### Component 2: Card

**Purpose:** Visual container for task information in Kanban/Timeline views

**Variants:** Compact (120px min height, title + metadata), Expanded (180px, includes description), Selected (blue border + checkbox), Dragging (60% opacity)

**States:** Default, Hover (elevated shadow + quick actions), Focus (blue ring), Active Edit (yellow pulse when others editing), Updated (green flash), Overdue (red border)

**Key Elements:** Card ID (monospace), title (2-line truncate), assignee avatars (max 3 stacked), priority dot, labels, story points badge, PR badge, CI status, due date, comment count

**Usage Guidelines:** Always show Card ID for developer reference, 2-line title limit for density, consistent color coding (Priority, Labels, PR status), immediate drag/drop visual feedback

#### Component 3: Input (Text Field)

**Purpose:** Single-line text entry for forms, search, inline editing

**Variants:** Text (standard), Search (with icon + clear button), Inline Edit (no border until focus), With Icon (left/right decoration)

**States:** Default, Hover (darker border), Focus (blue border + glow), Error (red border + message), Disabled, Success (green border)

**Sizes:** Small (32px), Medium (40px), Large (48px)

**Usage Guidelines:** Labels always visible above input, inline validation on blur, search inputs debounce 300ms, inline edit: double-click or E to activate, Enter/blur saves, Escape cancels

#### Component 4: Select (Dropdown)

**Purpose:** Choose one option from a list (assignees, priority, sprints, columns)

**Variants:** Single Select, Multi-Select (shows count badge or chips), Combobox (searchable for long lists)

**States:** Closed (shows selection + chevron), Open (dropdown panel), Focus (blue ring), Loading (skeleton/spinner), Empty ("No options found")

**Key Elements:** Trigger button with selection + chevron, Dropdown panel (max-height 320px, scrollable), Option items with hover state + checkmarks

**Usage Guidelines:** Use Combobox for lists >10 items, Multi-select shows "X selected" when >3 chosen, keyboard nav (arrows, Enter, Escape), intelligent positioning (below/above based on space)

#### Component 5: Modal (Dialog)

**Purpose:** Focused overlay for complex forms, confirmations, content requiring attention

**Variants:** Small (400px - confirmations), Medium (600px - forms), Large (800px - complex content), Full-Screen (onboarding, mobile)

**States:** Opening (fade + scale animation 150ms), Open (backdrop + focus trap), Closing (fade-out, return focus)

**Key Elements:** Backdrop (rgba(0,0,0,0.6) with blur), Container (white, rounded, shadow, centered), Header (title + close X), Content (scrollable, 24px padding), Footer (Cancel + CTA buttons)

**Usage Guidelines:** Escape to close (unless blocking), focus close button on open, destructive confirmations require typing name, avoid nested modals

#### Component 6: Badge

**Purpose:** Small status indicators, counts, labels (PR badges, story points, priority)

**Variants:** Solid (colored background), Outline (colored border), Dot (just colored circle)

**States:** Default, Hover (optional tooltip), Interactive (clickable with pointer cursor)

**Colors:** Status (green success, blue info, yellow warning, red error, gray neutral), Priority (blue/yellow/orange/red), Custom Labels (8 presets + hex)

**Sizes:** Extra Small (16px, icon only), Small (20px, short text), Medium (24px, longer text)

**Usage Guidelines:** Use sparingly to avoid visual noise, group related badges with 4px gaps, tooltips for abbreviated content

#### Component 7: Tooltip

**Purpose:** Contextual help text, explanations, keyboard shortcuts

**Variants:** Simple (plain text), Rich (formatted text + icons + shortcuts)

**States:** Hidden (default), Showing (hover after 500ms delay, fade-in 100ms), Focus (appears on keyboard focus)

**Positioning:** Auto (intelligently positions based on viewport space), Arrow pointer to source element

**Usage Guidelines:** Concise text (<20 words), show keyboard shortcuts in tooltips, no tooltips on mobile (no hover), 500ms delay prevents spam

#### Component 8: Toast Notification

**Purpose:** Temporary feedback messages for actions, errors, system updates

**Variants:** Info (blue + icon), Success (green + checkmark), Warning (yellow + alert), Error (red + X)

**States:** Appearing (slide-in from top-right 200ms), Visible (persists 4s), Disappearing (fade-out), Dismissing (immediate on X click)

**Key Elements:** Status icon (left), Message (1-2 lines max), Action Button optional (Retry, Undo, View Details), Close button (X, always present)

**Usage Guidelines:** Use for async action feedback, Error toasts include actionable text (Retry button, docs link), stack max 3 visible, auto-dismiss 4s (success/info) or persist (errors)

## Branding & Style Guide

### Visual Identity

**Brand Guidelines:** To be developed (or link to existing company brand guidelines if applicable)

**Design Philosophy:** Clean, modern, professional aesthetic that signals technical sophistication rather than consumer playfulness. Taskly is a power tool for developers, not a casual productivity app. Visual language should evoke precision, speed, and reliability.

**Reference Inspiration:**
- **GitHub:** Monospace fonts for code elements, Octicon iconography, subdued color palette
- **Linear:** Fast animations (200-300ms), keyboard-first UI, generous whitespace
- **Vercel:** High contrast in dark mode, clean typography, minimalist layouts
- **VS Code:** Syntax highlighting patterns for code snippets, dark theme as default option

**Color System Notes:**
- All colors tested for WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 minimum for text, 3:1 for UI components)
- Neutral palette provides 5 shades sufficient for most UI needs
- Priority colors distinct for color-blind users (tested with Coblis simulator)
- Success/Warning/Error colors consistent with GitHub convention

### Typography

#### Font Families

- **Primary (UI Text):** `Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
  - Rationale: Inter is highly legible at small sizes, excellent for data-dense interfaces
- **Secondary (Headings):** Same as Primary (maintains consistency)
- **Monospace (Code/IDs):** `"Fira Code", "JetBrains Mono", "SF Mono", Consolas, Monaco, monospace`
  - Usage: Card IDs, branch names, commit SHAs, PR numbers, code snippets

#### Type Scale

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Usage |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **H1** | 32px (2rem) | 700 (Bold) | 40px (1.25) | -0.02em | Page titles, onboarding |
| **H2** | 24px (1.5rem) | 600 (Semibold) | 32px (1.33) | -0.01em | Section headings, modal titles |
| **H3** | 20px (1.25rem) | 600 (Semibold) | 28px (1.4) | 0em | Subsection headers, card tabs |
| **H4** | 16px (1rem) | 600 (Semibold) | 24px (1.5) | 0em | Column headers, settings sections |
| **Body** | 14px (0.875rem) | 400 (Regular) | 20px (1.43) | 0em | Default text, descriptions, forms |
| **Body Small** | 12px (0.75rem) | 400 (Regular) | 16px (1.33) | 0em | Timestamps, helper text, metadata |
| **Label** | 12px (0.75rem) | 600 (Semibold) | 16px (1.33) | 0.05em | Form labels, badges, navigation |
| **Monospace** | 13px (0.8125rem) | 400 (Regular) | 20px (1.54) | 0em | Card IDs, branch names, code |

**Typography Notes:**
- Base font size 14px for information density in developer tools
- Line heights calculated for readability (1.43 for body text)
- Negative letter spacing for large headings (optical adjustment), positive for small labels

### Iconography

**Icon Library:** Heroicons v2 (outline style, 24x24 base, 2px stroke) + GitHub Octicons for Git-specific indicators

**Heroicons Usage:** Navigation (home, folder, cog, user-circle), Actions (plus, pencil, trash, x-mark, magnifying-glass), Status (check-circle, exclamation-triangle, x-circle, clock), Interaction (chevron-down, arrows-up-down, funnel, ellipsis-horizontal)

**GitHub Octicons Usage:** Git elements (git-branch, git-pull-request, git-commit, git-merge), Repository (repo, star, fork), CI/CD (check, x, dot-fill, skip)

**Icon Guidelines:**
- Stroke Weight: 2px (ensures clarity at small sizes)
- Size Scale: 16px (inline), 20px (buttons), 24px (headers), 32px (empty states)
- Color: Inherit text color by default, override for status icons
- Accessibility: Always pair with text label or ARIA label
- Alignment: Center-align vertically with adjacent text

### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:** Flexbox-based responsive grid for browser compatibility

**Container Widths:**
- Max Content Width: 1600px (centered) for dashboard, settings
- Full Bleed: No max-width for Kanban, Timeline (horizontal scroll)
- Modal Widths: 400px / 600px / 800px

**Spacing Scale (8px Base Grid):**

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `space-1` | 4px | Icon-text gaps, badge spacing |
| `space-2` | 8px | Form field rhythm, card padding |
| `space-3` | 12px | Card gaps, button padding |
| `space-4` | 16px | Section margins, column gaps, modal padding |
| `space-6` | 24px | Large section spacing, modal content |
| `space-8` | 32px | Page-level spacing, major dividers |
| `space-12` | 48px | Hero sections, wizard padding |

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: <768px (single column, simplified)
- Tablet: 768-1024px (2 columns, condensed)
- Desktop: 1024-1440px (standard layout)
- Wide: >1440px (max 4 Kanban columns visible)

**User Testing:** Recruit 2-3 developers with disabilities for beta testing

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Mobile** | 0px | 767px | iPhone, Android phones (portrait) |
| **Tablet** | 768px | 1023px | iPad, Android tablets, small laptops |
| **Desktop** | 1024px | 1439px | Standard laptops, monitors (1080p) |
| **Wide** | 1440px | - | Large monitors (1440p, 4K) |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:**
- **Mobile (<768px):** Single-column stacked layout, full-width cards, horizontal swipe between columns via tab selector, command palette disabled (no keyboard), read-only experience with "Best on desktop" persistent banner
- **Tablet (768-1023px):** 2-column grid for dashboard, condensed Kanban columns (280px width, scrollable horizontally), Timeline view collapses Planning Mode sidebar, touch-optimized controls (larger buttons, long-press for drag)
- **Desktop (1024-1439px):** Standard multi-column Kanban (3-4 columns visible), full Timeline view with Planning Mode, all keyboard shortcuts enabled, hover states active
- **Wide (1440px+):** Max 4-5 Kanban columns visible without scroll, Timeline shows more sprints simultaneously, optional dual-pane layout for Card Detail (side panel instead of modal)

**Navigation Changes:**
- **Mobile:** Hamburger menu for primary navigation, bottom tab bar for view switching (Kanban/Timeline), workspace switcher in menu drawer
- **Tablet:** Condensed top navigation, icon-only workspace switcher, filters in overflow menu (⋯)
- **Desktop/Wide:** Full navigation bar, all controls visible, breadcrumbs displayed

**Content Priority:**
- **Mobile:** Show essential metadata only (assignees, priority, PR status), hide secondary info (story points, labels, due date) until card opened, collapse description to 1 line with "Read more"
- **Tablet:** Show primary + secondary metadata, 2-line card titles, abbreviated labels
- **Desktop/Wide:** Full metadata display, 2-3 line card titles, all labels visible

**Interaction Changes:**
- **Mobile:** Tap to select cards (no hover), long-press (500ms) for context menu, swipe gestures (swipe card right to assign, left to delete - with confirmation)
- **Tablet:** Long-press (500ms) to activate drag mode, tap to open card detail, two-finger pinch to zoom Timeline
- **Desktop:** Mouse hover for quick actions, click-and-drag for cards, right-click for context menu, keyboard shortcuts fully enabled

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Speed & Timing:**
- **Fast (100-150ms):** Hover states, focus indicators, tooltip appearances - instant feedback
- **Standard (200ms):** Button presses, dropdown openings, card selection - perceivably smooth without lag
- **Complex (300ms):** Modal openings/closings, view transitions (Kanban ↔ Timeline), card drag-and-drop - allow user to track element movement
- **Slow (400-500ms):** Page transitions, onboarding step changes - significant context shifts

**Easing Functions:**
- **Ease-out (default):** Used for entrances (modals opening, toasts appearing) - starts fast, decelerates to rest
- **Ease-in:** Used for exits (modals closing, elements hiding) - accelerates as it leaves
- **Ease-in-out:** Used for state changes (card moving between columns, view switching) - smooth acceleration and deceleration
- **Spring (elastic):** Reserved for celebratory moments (successful PR merge, sprint completion) - bouncy, playful feedback

**Performance:**
- All animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) not CPU-bound properties (width, height, top, left)
- Animations disabled when user enables "Reduce motion" OS setting (instant state changes instead)
- Max 60 FPS (16.67ms per frame) maintained for smooth perception

### Key Animations

- **Card Drag-and-Drop:** Drag start: Card lifts with scale(1.05) + shadow increase (200ms ease-out), During drag: Ghost preview at 60% opacity follows cursor, Drop: Card animates to destination with ease-in-out (300ms), Invalid drop: Snap back to origin with elastic bounce (400ms)
- **Modal Open/Close:** Open: Backdrop fades in (150ms) + modal scales from 0.95 to 1.0 (200ms ease-out), Close: Modal fades + scales to 0.95 (150ms ease-in) + backdrop fades
- **Toast Notification:** Appear: Slide in from top-right + fade in (200ms ease-out), Dismiss: Fade out + slide right (200ms ease-in)
- **View Transition (Kanban ↔ Timeline):** Cross-fade (300ms ease-in-out), outgoing view fades + scales to 0.98, incoming view fades in + scales from 0.98 to 1.0
- **Card Auto-Move on PR Merge:** Card pulses green (500ms), brief confetti animation (1s, optional), slides to Done column with arc trajectory (500ms ease-in-out), drops into place with subtle bounce
- **Focus Indicator:** Instant appearance (0ms), blue ring fades in when tabbing through elements (100ms ease-out)
- **Loading Spinners:** Continuous rotation (1s linear loop), fade in after 300ms delay (prevents flash for fast operations)
- **Hover Effects:** Button background darkens (100ms ease-out), Card elevates with shadow (150ms ease-out), Icon color change (100ms)
- **Command Palette:** Open: Backdrop fades + palette slides down from top (150ms ease-out), Close: Reverse animation (150ms ease-in)
- **Skeleton Loaders:** Shimmer effect (1.5s linear loop), subtle gradient sweep for loading states

**Micro-interaction Details:**
- **Button Click:** Scale to 0.98 on press (100ms), return to 1.0 on release (100ms ease-out) - provides tactile feedback
- **Checkbox Toggle:** Checkmark draws in with stroke animation (200ms ease-out), bounce on completion (50ms)
- **Toggle Switch:** Knob slides across track (200ms ease-in-out), background color transitions simultaneously
- **Inline Edit Activation:** Border fades in (150ms), cursor appears with blink animation
- **Real-Time Update:** Card border flashes blue briefly (300ms pulse), fades back to normal - subtle attention draw without disruption

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial load <1 second (cached), <2 seconds (cold start) - Lighthouse performance score >90
- **Interaction Response:** All user interactions (clicks, drags, keyboard shortcuts) respond within 100ms, perceived as instant
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60 FPS (16.67ms per frame) for all animations and transitions, no janky frames

### Design Strategies

**Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:**
- Route-based code splitting: Dashboard, Board (Kanban/Timeline), Settings loaded as separate chunks
- Component lazy loading: Card Detail modal, Command Palette, Onboarding Wizard loaded on-demand
- Image lazy loading: User avatars, board illustrations load as they enter viewport (Intersection Observer)
- Below-the-fold content deferred: Activity timeline loads first 20 events, "Load More" for older items

**Virtualization:**
- Kanban columns with 50+ cards: Virtualize rendering with react-window or react-virtualized, only render visible cards + 5-item buffer
- Timeline sprints: Virtualize horizontal scroll, render visible sprints + adjacent sprints only
- Long dropdown lists (repositories, users): Virtualize with react-select or Radix Select, render visible options only

**Optimistic UI:**
- All user actions (card move, edit, create) update UI immediately before API response
- Show loading indicator inline (spinner replacing action button) during async operation
- Rollback UI changes if API fails, display error toast with retry option
- Prevents perceived lag - user continues working while backend processes request

**Caching & State Management:**
- Frontend caching with React Query: Cache board data for 5 minutes, background refetch on window focus
- Frequently accessed data cached: Workspace members, board list, user profile (localStorage with 1-hour TTL)
- WebSocket updates invalidate cache: PR status change triggers cache refresh for affected cards
- Avoid redundant API calls: Dedupe simultaneous requests to same endpoint

**Image & Asset Optimization:**
- User avatars: Serve optimized WebP format with PNG fallback, size variants (32px, 48px, 64px) for different contexts
- Illustrations: SVG for scalable graphics (empty states, onboarding), optimized with SVGO
- Icon sprites: Single SVG sprite sheet for Heroicons/Octicons, reduce HTTP requests
- Font loading: Preload Inter font with font-display: swap, system font fallback during load (prevent FOUT)

**Bundle Size Optimization:**
- JavaScript bundle target: <500KB gzipped total, <200KB per route chunk
- Tree shaking: Remove unused Tailwind classes with PurgeCSS, eliminate dead code
- Compression: Brotli compression on server (better than gzip), static asset CDN caching
- Dependency audit: Avoid heavy libraries (Moment.js → date-fns for smaller bundle), analyze with webpack-bundle-analyzer

**Rendering Optimization:**
- React.memo for expensive components: Card, ColumnHeader, SprintColumn (prevent unnecessary re-renders)
- useMemo/useCallback for computations and callbacks: Memoize filtered card lists, sorted columns
- Debouncing: Search input (300ms), inline edit auto-save (2s), filter changes (300ms)
- Throttling: Scroll events for infinite loading (200ms), drag tracking (16ms/60fps)
