# Project Brief: Taskly

## Executive Summary

**Taskly** is a Git-native project management application that eliminates wasted developer time by seamlessly synchronizing visual task boards with code repositories. Unlike traditional tools like Trello that require developers to maintain separate systems for task tracking and code management, Taskly treats the project board as a "control surface for your repo"—where moving a card automatically triggers Git operations (branch creation, PR setup, environment provisioning) and code activity (commits, CI runs, deployments) updates card status in real-time.

The primary problem being solved is **preventable rework caused by context loss**: when reviewers lack task context during code review, code misaligns with requirements, forcing costly rework cycles. Taskly solves this by maintaining bidirectional synchronization between tasks and code, ensuring every PR is linked to its requirement, every commit updates progress automatically, and teams never waste time on double-entry or manual status updates.

**Target market:** Software development teams (5-50 developers) currently using tools like Trello, Jira, or Linear alongside GitHub/GitLab, who struggle with context switching and keeping project management tools in sync with actual code progress.

**Key value proposition:** "Move a Card, Ship the Code" - developers get Trello-simple visual management with the power of automated Git workflows, eliminating ceremony while preserving complete task-to-code traceability.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Software development teams today operate in a fragmented workflow environment where task management and code development exist in separate, poorly-connected systems. Developers use visual project management tools (Trello, Jira, Linear) to organize work, but these tools have no meaningful integration with where the actual work happens: Git repositories, pull requests, and CI/CD pipelines.

This fragmentation creates a cascade of problems:

**1. Double-Entry Tax**
Developers must manually update both the project board AND GitHub—moving a Trello card to "In Progress," then creating a branch, then opening a PR, then updating the card again when code is submitted. This constant context-switching between tools wastes 15-30 minutes per task, adding up to 5-10 hours per developer per week.

**2. Context Loss at Critical Moments**
When a reviewer opens a pull request, they see code changes but lack immediate access to:
- The original requirement or user story
- Acceptance criteria and edge cases
- Design decisions or architectural discussions
- Related tasks or dependencies

Without this context, reviewers either:
- Request information from the author (adding delay)
- Make assumptions (leading to misaligned feedback)
- Approve without full understanding (allowing misalignment to ship)

**3. Preventable Rework Cycles**
Our Five Whys analysis revealed the root consequence: when reviewers lack context, code doesn't align with actual requirements. This misalignment forces costly rework cycles—developers rewriting code, retesting, re-reviewing—wasting hours or days that could have been prevented with better context preservation.

**4. Visibility Gaps**
Managers and stakeholders can't see real progress because project boards don't reflect actual code status. A card marked "In Progress" might have a stalled PR with failing tests, but the board shows green. This disconnect undermines planning and erodes trust in project tracking.

### Impact of the Problem

**Time waste:** Conservatively, double-entry and rework consume 10-15% of developer capacity—equivalent to losing 1-2 developers on a team of 10.

**Quality degradation:** Rushed reviews without context introduce bugs and technical debt that compound over time.

**Team friction:** Constant "what's the status?" questions and misaligned expectations create frustration and communication overhead.

**Strategic cost:** Leadership can't make informed decisions when project data is stale or disconnected from reality.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Trello/Asana:** Beautiful, simple boards but zero Git integration. Teams love the UX but hate the manual sync burden.

**Jira:** Offers some Git linking (via plugins) but is heavyweight, slow, and optimized for enterprise process compliance rather than developer velocity.

**Linear/Height/Shortcut:** Modern dev-focused tools with better Git integrations, but still treat the board and repo as separate systems requiring manual linking. They don't offer true bidirectional automation.

**GitHub Projects:** Native to GitHub but limited project management capabilities—no timeline view, weak filtering, minimal metadata support.

None of these tools treat the board as a "control surface" that actively manages Git workflows. They're passive tracking systems, not active orchestration layers.

### Urgency and Importance

The shift to remote/distributed work has intensified these problems—teams can't walk over to ask context questions, making async context preservation more critical. Meanwhile, developer hiring costs and retention challenges make productivity gains from eliminating waste increasingly valuable. Teams that solve the "fragmented tooling" problem gain a measurable competitive advantage in velocity and quality.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

Taskly reimagines project management as **active workflow orchestration** rather than passive task tracking. The core innovation is treating the visual project board as a direct interface to Git operations—where dragging a card isn't just updating metadata, it's triggering actual development workflow steps.

The solution has three foundational pillars:

**1. Bidirectional Git-Native Synchronization**
- **Board → Git:** Moving a card to "In Progress" auto-creates a feature branch with naming conventions, scaffolds initial commit structure, and opens a draft PR with templates pre-filled
- **Git → Board:** Commits update card progress, CI runs update status indicators, PR reviews trigger card notifications, merges auto-move cards to "Done"
- **Context Preservation:** Every card maintains deep links to its PRs, commits, branches, test results, and deployment status—making context instantly accessible

**2. Multi-View Intelligence System**
Three complementary views of the same data, each revealing different insights:
- **Kanban View:** Traditional card-based workflow for individual developers to manage daily tasks
- **Timeline View:** Sprint and release planning showing workload distribution, dependency chains, and capacity balancing across time
- **Calendar View:** Deadline management, milestone tracking, and availability visualization (time off, holidays)

Switching between views is instant (<1 second), filters and selections persist, and each view can trigger different bulk actions optimized for that perspective.

**3. Developer-First UX Philosophy**
- **Keyboard-first commands:** ⌘+K command palette for power users who hate clicking
- **Bulk operations:** Lasso multiple cards to batch-assign, update metadata, or generate sub-tasks
- **Zero-lag interface:** Optimistic UI updates, background sync, sub-second view transitions
- **Smart automation without AI imposition:** Auto-generate status reports from activity data, suggest reviewers based on code ownership, populate PR templates—but never force AI-suggested tasks

### Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions

**vs. Trello:** We preserve Trello's simplicity and visual elegance but eliminate the "dumb board" limitation—cards become live connections to code, not just metadata containers.

**vs. Jira:** We prioritize developer velocity over enterprise process compliance. No mandatory fields, no complex workflows, no heavyweight administration—just boards that work the way developers actually think.

**vs. Linear/Height:** While they offer Git linking, we go further with true bidirectional automation. Their integrations are addons; our Git-native sync is the foundation.

**vs. GitHub Projects:** We match their native Git integration but add professional project management capabilities—multiple views, rich metadata, planning tools, and cross-repo coordination.

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

**1. Eliminates the Root Cause**
By preserving task-to-code context automatically, we prevent the reviewer context loss that causes misaligned code and wasted rework. This directly addresses the root problem identified in our Five Whys analysis.

**2. Developer Adoption Through Delight**
Developers will use Taskly daily because it *feels fast*—keyboard shortcuts, instant view switching, zero lag. When tools respect developer time, adoption follows naturally.

**3. Manager Value Without Developer Burden**
Managers get the visibility they need (workload balancing, delivery confidence, quality trends) from activity data developers are already generating. No forcing developers to "update the board for reporting."

**4. Network Effects from Integration**
The tighter Taskly integrates with Git/CI/CD, the more valuable it becomes. Every commit enriches the board, every PR adds context, creating a flywheel of increasing utility.

### High-Level Product Vision

Imagine a development team where:
- A PM drags a card to "Ready for Dev" and a developer immediately sees it with full context, acceptance criteria, and design links
- The developer drags it to "In Progress" and their branch, commit structure, and draft PR are created instantly
- They push code and the card automatically updates with CI status, test coverage, and deployment preview links
- A reviewer opens the PR and sees the original requirement, acceptance criteria, and dependency context inline
- The reviewer approves, the PR merges, and the card auto-moves to "Done" while generating a release note entry
- The manager checks the Timeline view and sees sprint capacity is balanced, no features are at risk, and the upcoming release is on track

**That's Taskly:** A world where the board and the code are perfectly synchronized, context is never lost, and developers spend time building instead of updating tools.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

1. **Kanban Board with Git Linking:**
   - Drag-and-drop card management across customizable columns (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done)
   - Each card links to one or more GitHub/GitLab issues or PRs
   - Manual linking via URL or auto-detection when branch/PR references card ID
   - Card displays linked PR status, commits, and CI status inline
   - *Rationale:* Validates core hypothesis that context preservation (card↔code linking) solves the review context problem. Kanban first because it's the most familiar view.

2. **Comprehensive Card Metadata:**
   - Title, description, acceptance criteria (markdown support)
   - Assignees (one or multiple), priority (Low/Medium/High/Urgent), labels/tags
   - Story points, sprint assignment, due dates
   - Comments and activity timeline
   - *Rationale:* Developers need rich metadata to make the board useful for actual project management, not just a pretty UI. This is table stakes.

3. **Basic Git Integration (GitHub OAuth):**
   - Connect Taskly workspace to GitHub organization/repos via OAuth
   - When moving card to "In Progress," offer one-click branch creation with naming convention (e.g., `feature/TASK-123-brief-description`)
   - When card is linked to PR, show PR status (draft/ready/approved/merged) and update card automatically when PR state changes
   - When PR is merged, optionally auto-move card to "Done"
   - *Rationale:* This is the minimum Git integration to eliminate double-entry. Start with GitHub (larger market share), add GitLab in Phase 2.

4. **Timeline View (Sprint Planning):**
   - Horizontal timeline showing sprints/iterations
   - Cards grouped by sprint with story point totals
   - Drag cards between sprints to rebalance workload
   - Visual capacity indicators (overloaded vs. balanced)
   - *Rationale:* Multi-view differentiation starts here. Timeline view validates the "workload balancing" scenario from brainstorming. Critical for manager adoption.

5. **Keyboard-First Commands:**
   - ⌘+K command palette for quick actions (create card, search, assign, change status, navigate)
   - Keyboard navigation through cards and views
   - Common shortcuts (J/K for card navigation, C for create, E for edit)
   - *Rationale:* Developer adoption depends on speed. Keyboard shortcuts signal "we respect your time." Low effort, high impact.

6. **Team & Workspace Management:**
   - Create workspace, invite team members via email
   - Basic role permissions (admin, member)
   - Multiple boards per workspace
   - *Rationale:* Can't validate team adoption without basic collaboration features. Keep permissions simple for MVP.

7. **Bulk Actions (Basic):**
   - Multi-select cards (shift-click or checkbox)
   - Batch operations: assign multiple cards, add labels, change priority, move to column
   - *Rationale:* Directly addresses "tedious project management" pain point from brainstorming. Developers love batch operations.

### Out of Scope for MVP

- **Calendar View** - Timeline view covers planning needs for MVP; calendar adds complexity without validating core hypothesis
- **Automated PR Creation with Templates** - One-click branch creation is enough for MVP; auto-PR requires more complex GitHub App permissions
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration** - Showing PR status is enough; deep CI integration (test results, deployment status) is Phase 2
- **Auto-Generated Status Reports** - Manual reporting reduction can wait until we have enough activity data to make summaries useful
- **Dependency Heatmaps & Blocking Detection** - Complex feature requiring code analysis; defer until post-MVP
- **"What-If" Planning Mode** - Advanced manager feature; Timeline view drag-and-drop is sufficient for MVP
- **GitLab Support** - Start with GitHub only to reduce integration complexity; add GitLab in Phase 2 based on demand
- **DevOps Dashboard (Deployment Tracking)** - Out of scope for developer + manager personas; focus on code review context first
- **Mobile App** - Web-first; mobile can come later if desktop validation succeeds
- **Advanced Permissions (RBAC)** - Simple admin/member roles are enough; granular permissions add complexity without MVP value
- **Integrations (Slack, Figma, etc.)** - Focus on Git integration first; other integrations are nice-to-have

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful if, after 8 weeks of development and 4 weeks of beta testing with 10 teams (50+ developers):

1. **Core Value Validated:** 70%+ of beta users report that card-to-PR linking made code reviews easier/faster
2. **Time Savings Demonstrated:** Users report spending 3+ fewer hours per week on board updates vs. their previous tool
3. **Git Integration Reliability:** 90%+ success rate on branch creation and PR status syncing
4. **Multi-View Usage:** 50%+ of users switch between Kanban and Timeline views at least once per session
5. **Adoption Within Teams:** When one team member invites colleagues, 50%+ join and use the product within 1 week
6. **Developer Satisfaction:** Beta users rate the product 8+/10 for "respects my time" and "easy to use daily"
7. **Technical Performance:** <1 second page load, <3 seconds for Git operations, zero downtime during beta

If these criteria are met, we proceed to broader launch. If not, we iterate based on feedback before expanding user base.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

Once MVP validates product-market fit and achieves success criteria, Phase 2 (3-6 months post-MVP) focuses on deepening Git integration and expanding the "control surface" capabilities:

**1. Full Git Autopilot ("Move a Card, Ship the Code")**
- Moving card to "In Progress" auto-creates branch AND draft PR with template pre-filled
- Moving to "In Review" assigns reviewers based on code ownership (CODEOWNERS file)
- Moving to "QA" triggers preview environment deployment
- Webhook-based bidirectional sync: commits update card progress, PR comments appear as card comments, CI failures trigger card notifications

**2. Calendar View**
- Deadline-focused view with milestones, release dates, and sprint boundaries
- Visualize team availability (holidays, time off, scheduled meetings)
- Drag cards to adjust due dates, see conflicts and dependencies

**3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
- Display test coverage, passing/failing tests inline on cards
- Link deployment status (staging deployed, production live) to cards
- Show build times, error logs, and performance metrics
- Alert on failing builds or deployment issues directly in card

**4. Auto-Generated Status Reports & Summaries**
- Weekly sprint summaries auto-compiled from activity (commits, completions, blockers)
- Stakeholder reports in plain language ready to share
- Release notes auto-generated from completed cards

**5. GitLab Support**
- Full parity with GitHub integration (OAuth, branch creation, MR linking, webhooks)
- Multi-platform teams can connect both GitHub and GitLab repos to one workspace

**6. Advanced Bulk Actions**
- Generate sub-tasks from PR diff analysis or test files
- Batch link cards to existing PRs by pattern matching
- Template-based card creation (create 10 cards from CSV or JSON)

**7. Dependency Tracking & Visualization**
- Manual dependency links between cards (blocks/blocked-by relationships)
- Visual dependency graph showing critical path
- Alert when blocked cards are assigned or scheduled

### Long-Term Vision (1-2 Years)

**The Ultimate Developer Workflow Hub:**

Taskly evolves from a project board into the **central orchestration layer** for the entire development lifecycle:

- **Code Intelligence:** Automatically detect which cards touch which code modules; surface blockers based on code dependencies, not just manual links

- **Testing:** pytest, pytest-asyncio, factory_boy for fixtures
- **Deployment:** Docker Compose for both development and production (no Kubernetes complexity for MVP)

**Database: PostgreSQL 15+**
- **Why PostgreSQL:** JSONB for flexible metadata, excellent full-text search, mature replication, strong consistency
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async support) with Alembic for migrations
- **Schema Design:**
  - Core tables: workspaces, boards, cards, users, teams
  - Git entities: repositories, branches, pull_requests, commits (cached from GitHub)
  - Relationships: many-to-many for cards↔PRs, users↔workspaces
- **Indexing Strategy:** B-tree indexes on foreign keys, GIN indexes on JSONB metadata for fast filtering
- **Caching:** Redis for session data, frequently accessed boards, rate limiting

**Hosting/Infrastructure: Docker + Cloud Platform**
- **Containerization:** Docker Compose for local dev, multi-container setup (Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery worker)

- **Monitoring:** Sentry for error tracking, Datadog or Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, structured logging (JSON logs)

### Architecture Considerations

**Repository Structure**
- **Monorepo approach:** Single repository with separate directories for frontend (`/frontend`) and backend (`/backend`)
  - **Pros:** Easier coordination during rapid development, atomic commits spanning FE+BE, simpler CI/CD
  - **Cons:** Larger repo size, requires tooling to manage (Nx or Turborepo)
  - **Alternative:** Separate repos if teams grow and need independent deployment cadence

**Service Architecture**
- **Monolithic API:** Single FastAPI application handling all endpoints
  - Simpler to develop, debug, and deploy with Docker Compose
  - Avoid microservices complexity; scale vertically first (larger containers) before considering horizontal scaling
- **Job Queue Pattern:** Separate Celery worker processes for long-running tasks:
  - Git operations (branch creation, webhook processing)
  - Bulk actions (batch card updates, report generation)
  - Email notifications
- **WebSocket Service:** Dedicated WebSocket server (can be part of FastAPI or separate) for real-time board updates

**Integration Requirements**
- **GitHub OAuth & API:**
  - OAuth App registration for user authentication
  - GitHub App installation for deeper permissions (webhook subscriptions, write access to repos)
  - Webhook endpoints to receive PR updates, commit events, CI status changes
  - Rate limiting handling (5000 req/hour for authenticated users)
- **Webhook Reliability:**
  - Idempotent webhook handlers (handle duplicate deliveries)
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Dead letter queue for failed webhook processing
- **Third-Party Services:**
  - Email: SendGrid or AWS SES for transactional emails (invites, notifications)
  - File storage: S3 or equivalent for attachments (if cards support file uploads post-MVP)

**Security/Compliance**
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - GitHub OAuth for signup/login (no password management)
  - JWT tokens with short expiration (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
  - RBAC: workspace-level permissions (admin, member)
- **Data Protection:**
  - HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.3)
  - Encryption at rest for PostgreSQL (AWS RDS encryption)
  - Secrets management: Environment variables via Docker secrets or AWS Secrets Manager
  - API rate limiting: per-user and per-IP to prevent abuse
- **Compliance:**
  - GDPR compliance: user data export, right to deletion
  - SOC 2 considerations for future enterprise tier (audit logs, access controls)
  - GitHub token storage: encrypted in database, never logged
- **Vulnerability Management:**
  - Dependabot for dependency updates
  - Regular security audits (npm audit, pip-audit, Snyk)
  - Penetration testing before production launch

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Budget:**
- **MVP Development:** Bootstrap/self-funded or seed round ($50k-150k runway)
- **Infrastructure Costs:** Targeting <$500/month for MVP (cloud hosting, third-party services)
- **Team Size:** 1-3 developers (solo founder or small co-founding team)
- **Marketing Budget:** Minimal paid acquisition; relying on organic growth and developer communities
- **Constraint Impact:** Must prioritize ruthlessly; GitHub-only integration, no enterprise features, web-only (no mobile)

**Timeline:**
- **MVP Delivery:** 8-10 weeks from project kickoff to beta-ready product
- **Beta Testing:** 4 weeks with 10 teams before broader launch
- **Go-to-Market:** Week 13-16 (public launch, Product Hunt, community outreach)
- **Product-Market Fit Validation:** 6 months from launch to hit 100 active teams
- **Constraint Impact:** Must use proven technologies; limited time for R&D or custom solutions; monorepo and monolithic architecture to move fast

**Resources:**
- **Development Team:** 1-2 full-stack engineers (or solo founder wearing all hats)
- **Design Resources:** Minimal custom design; leverage component libraries (shadcn/ui) and templates
- **QA/Testing:** No dedicated QA; developer-led testing + beta user feedback
- **DevOps:** Docker Compose + managed cloud services to avoid Kubernetes operational overhead
- **Constraint Impact:** No dedicated specialists; full-stack generalists required; automation and simplicity are critical

**Technical:**
- **GitHub API Rate Limits:** 5000 requests/hour per authenticated user; must implement aggressive caching and webhook-based updates instead of polling
- **Real-Time Sync Challenges:** WebSocket connections have cost and complexity; must balance real-time UX with infrastructure simplicity
- **Data Migration Complexity:** Users switching from Trello/Jira won't have automated migration in MVP; must provide CSV import or manual setup
- **Browser Compatibility:** Modern web APIs only (no IE11, older Safari); may exclude ~5-10% of potential users
- **Docker Compose Scaling Limits:** Suitable for early-stage scale (<10k users); may need orchestration layer (Docker Swarm or managed container services) if scaling beyond 50k users
- **Constraint Impact:** Architecture designed around rate limits; webhook-first strategy; simplified onboarding without migration tools; vertical scaling first

### Key Assumptions

- **Market demand exists:** Software teams are actively frustrated with existing tools and willing to try alternatives (validated through dev community discussions, not formal research yet)

- **GitHub dominance:** 80%+ of target users use GitHub (not GitLab, Bitbucket); focusing on GitHub first won't exclude the majority

- **Bottom-up adoption works:** Individual developers will adopt first and champion to their teams; no need for top-down enterprise sales in MVP phase

- **Git-native is differentiated enough:** The board↔code linking value proposition is compelling enough to overcome switching costs from Trello/Jira/Linear

- **Developer time savings are measurable:** Users will recognize 3-5 hours/week saved from eliminating double-entry; this justifies eventual paid conversion

- **Freemium model is viable:** 15-20% of users will convert to paid tier for advanced features (based on industry benchmarks for dev tools)

- **Technical feasibility is sound:** GitHub API + webhooks + FastAPI async can reliably deliver <3 second Git operations at MVP scale (<10k users)

- **Team composition:** Founding team has full-stack experience with React, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker; no need for extensive learning curves

- **Competitive response time:** 6-12 months before Linear/Jira/Shortcut build comparable Git-native features; first-mover advantage window exists

- **Docker Compose sufficiency:** Docker Compose is adequate for MVP through early growth; sophisticated orchestration can be deferred until proven product-market fit

- **Regulatory compliance is manageable:** GDPR basics (data export, deletion) are implementable without legal team; SOC 2 deferred to enterprise phase

- **User research is lightweight:** Beta users provide qualitative feedback; formal user research (interviews, surveys) happens iteratively, not upfront

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **GitHub API Dependency:** Complete reliance on GitHub's API stability and rate limits. **Impact:** Service disruptions if GitHub has outages or changes API terms. **Mitigation:** Aggressive caching, webhook-based updates, graceful degradation when API is unavailable.

- **Competitive Response Speed:** Linear, Jira, or Shortcut could build comparable Git integration faster than expected. **Impact:** Loss of differentiation before achieving product-market fit. **Mitigation:** Move fast on MVP, establish brand as "Git-native leader," build community advocacy.

- **User Switching Costs:** Developers already invested in Trello/Jira may resist switching despite pain points. **Impact:** Lower adoption rates than projected. **Mitigation:** Provide seamless onboarding, CSV import from existing tools, demo videos showing time savings.

- **Technical Complexity Underestimation:** Bidirectional Git sync, webhooks, and real-time updates may be more complex than anticipated. **Impact:** MVP timeline slips beyond 8-10 weeks. **Mitigation:** Start with simplest Git integration (manual linking), add automation incrementally; buffer 2-3 weeks in timeline.

- **Market Size Uncertainty:** 5-50 developer teams using GitHub may be smaller addressable market than assumed. **Impact:** Slower growth, difficulty reaching 100 teams in 6 months. **Mitigation:** Validate market size through user research; consider expanding to larger teams or GitLab support earlier if needed.

- **Monetization Timing:** Introducing paid tiers too early or too late could impact growth or sustainability. **Impact:** Revenue shortfall or user churn. **Mitigation:** Launch with generous free tier, introduce paid features based on usage data and user feedback at 3-6 month mark.

- **Developer Adoption vs. Manager Buy-In:** Bottom-up adoption may fail if managers mandate existing tools (Jira) despite developer preference. **Impact:** Individual users can't champion Taskly to full team. **Mitigation:** Provide manager-focused value (Timeline view, auto-reports) early to address both personas.

### Open Questions

- **Pricing Strategy:** What features should be free vs. paid? Freemium, per-user pricing, or team-based tiers? When to introduce paid plans?

- **GitHub vs. GitLab Priority:** Is GitHub-first the right strategy, or should MVP support both from day one? What percentage of target market uses GitLab?

- **Onboarding Flow:** What's the optimal path from signup to first value (linked card → PR)? Should we require GitHub connection immediately or allow exploration first?

- **Team Collaboration Features:** Does MVP need real-time presence indicators (who's viewing/editing)? Comments, @mentions, notifications?

- **Mobile Strategy:** Is web-responsive enough, or will users demand native mobile apps for on-the-go updates?

- **Data Retention & Performance:** How long do we store Git event history (commits, PR updates)? Balance between rich history and database size/cost.

- **Board Templates:** Should MVP include pre-built board templates (Scrum, Kanban, Bug Triage), or let users create from scratch?

- **Permissions Granularity:** Are simple admin/member roles sufficient, or do users need card-level permissions (who can edit/delete specific cards)?

- **Internationalization:** Is English-only acceptable for MVP, or should we support multiple languages from the start?

- **Offline Support:** Should the web app work offline (with sync when reconnected), or require constant internet connection?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **User Acquisition Channels:** Which developer communities (Reddit, Hacker News, dev.to, Twitter/X) will be most effective for organic growth? What content strategy drives sign-ups?

- **Competitive Intelligence:** Deep dive into Linear, Height, Shortcut roadmaps—what are they building? Are they aware of Git-native opportunity?

- **Technical Feasibility Validation:** Prototype GitHub webhook handling and branch creation to validate <3 second performance assumption before full MVP build.

- **Developer Pain Point Quantification:** Conduct 10-20 interviews with target users to validate time waste estimates (5-10 hours/week) and prioritize feature importance.

- **Pricing Research:** Survey potential users on willingness to pay, acceptable price points, and which features justify paid tiers.

- **Scalability Testing:** Load test Docker Compose setup to understand real limits—100 users? 1000? 10k? When do we hit constraints?

- **Legal/Compliance Requirements:** Consult with legal advisor on GDPR, data privacy, terms of service, and GitHub API compliance.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Validate Core Hypothesis (Week 1-2)**
   - Conduct 10 user interviews with developers on teams using Trello/Jira + GitHub
   - Validate pain points (double-entry, context loss in code review)
   - Gauge willingness to switch tools and acceptable onboarding friction

2. **Technical Proof-of-Concept (Week 1-3)**
   - Build minimal prototype: GitHub OAuth + webhook listener + simple board UI
   - Test branch creation via API and PR status updates via webhook
   - Measure actual latency and identify technical blockers

3. **Finalize MVP Scope (Week 2)**
   - Review this brief with co-founders/advisors
