## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - 35 minutes

**Description:** Provocative "what if" questions to explore bold possibilities and creative features for the Trello-like application.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Manual Task Creation** - No AI task suggestions; users create tasks manually for full control
2. **Triple-View System** - Kanban, Timeline, and Calendar views for different contexts
3. **All Major Metadata** - Story points, priority, labels, assignments, dates, dependencies, etc.
4. **Workload Balancing Scenarios**
   - Kanban view shows which team members have too many "In Progress" tasks
   - Timeline view reveals overlapping assignments and overbooking during sprints
   - Calendar view visualizes time off or holidays affecting availability
   - Insight: Switching views prevents burnout by enabling quick workload rebalancing
5. **Release Coordination and Risk Tracking**
   - Timeline view highlights features tied to upcoming releases and their completion status
   - Calendar view shows release milestones and deadlines
   - Kanban view drills into blockers or incomplete stories threatening a release
   - Insight: Switching views spots release risks early for proactive adjustment
6. **Smart Project Templates** - Auto-generated board templates based on past projects or team patterns (e.g., "Sprint Board," "Bug Fix Cycle")
7. **Bulk Actions + Drag-and-Drop Magic** - Multi-select tasks to batch-assign people, change priorities, or move between stages
8. **Auto Status + Smart Summaries** - Auto-generate sprint summaries or status reports from activity data (completed tasks, commits, comments)
9. **KILLER FEATURE: "Move a Card, Ship the Code" - Git-Native Autopilot Board**
   - Drag a card â†’ auto-creates branch (naming convention), scaffold commits, PR with templates
   - Move to "Review" â†’ assigns reviewers automatically
   - Move to "QA" â†’ spins up preview environment
   - Move to "Done" â†’ merges behind protected rules
   - Autostatus from signals: commits, CI runs, test coverage, release tags update card status automatically
   - Live Dependency Graph: Cards understand code/module relationships; blockers surface automatically
   - One-gesture bulk operations: Lasso multiple cards for batch operations
   - Release-aware timeline: Milestones sync to calendars; slipping tests/PRs auto-flag release risk
   - **Value Proposition:** "The board isn't a to-do listâ€”it's the control surface for your repo"

**Insights Discovered:**
- Users want control over task creation, not AI automation forcing suggestions
- Multiple views aren't just nice-to-haveâ€”they reveal different dimensions of the same data (capacity, risk, timing)
- The real power is in intelligent automation that eliminates ceremony (branch creation, PR setup, reviewer assignment) triggered by simple card movements
- Bidirectional sync (boardâ†’Git AND Gitâ†’board) creates trust and eliminates double-entry

**Notable Connections:**
- Smart summaries eliminate manual status updates (addressing time waste)
- Git-native integration solves the "lose track of code-to-task" problem identified in Five Whys
- Multi-view system serves both individual developers (focus) and managers (visibility)

### Five Whys - 15 minutes

**Description:** Deep exploration of root motivations behind building this Git-integrated project management tool.

**The Five Whys Chain:**

1. **Why build this tool?**
   â†’ Tired of updating both Trello AND GitHub (double entry) + lose track of what code relates to which task

2. **Why is losing track of code-to-task relationship a problem?**
   â†’ Hard to review code without context

3. **Why does difficult code review matter?**
   â†’ Reviewers lack context to give good feedback

4. **Why is lacking context for feedback critical?**
   â†’ Code doesn't align with actual requirements

5. **Why is misalignment the ultimate problem?**
   â†’ **Wasted developer time on rework**

**Insights Discovered:**
- The root motivation isn't about "better project management"â€”it's about **protecting developer time** from preventable waste
- Every layer in the chain represents a preventable failure point that current tools don't address
- Context is the linchpin: without it, the entire development process breaks down
- The app's true value proposition: **"Stop wasting developer time on preventable rework"**

**Notable Connections:**
- This insight validates the "Move a Card, Ship the Code" killer featureâ€”it ensures context flows from task â†’ code â†’ review seamlessly
- Explains why Git-native integration isn't optionalâ€”it's the core mechanism for preserving context
- Frames all features through the lens of "Does this save developer time or waste it?"

### Role Playing - 40 minutes

**Description:** Exploring the app from six different stakeholder perspectives to uncover diverse needs, pain points, and requirements.

---

#### Perspective 1: Individual Developer

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Fast context switching** - Jump between Kanban â†’ Timeline â†’ Code view without losing filters or scroll position
2. **Smart automation** - Auto-assign reviewers, sync Git commits to tasks, generate changelogs automatically
3. **Keyboard-first commands** - Quick actions (e.g., âŒ˜+K â†’ new story) for power users who hate clicking
4. **No lag between views** - Transitions must be < 1 second to maintain focus
5. **Simple UI** - No overcomplicated panels or options when just updating a ticket
6. **Seamless Git/IDE integration** - Zero copy-paste of issue links manually
7. **THE ONE THING:** "Stay perfectly in sync with my code" - If the app always reflects real repo state (commits, branches, PRs, deployments), developers will trust it and live in it daily

**Insights:**
- Developers prioritize speed, simplicity, and trust above all
- They'll abandon tools that create friction or slow them down
- Keyboard shortcuts and fast UI are table stakes for daily use

---

#### Perspective 2: Tech Lead / Engineering Manager

**Ideas Generated:**

3. **Automatic stakeholder reports** - Weekly digests summarizing delivery progress, blockers, key decisions in plain language
4. **Drag-and-drop roadmap view** - Instantly see dependencies, deadlines, release scope
5. **Link features to goals** - Every initiative tied to a measurable KPI or OKR, so prioritization isn't guesswork
6. **Scenario planning** - Simulate "what happens if this slips?" to adjust timelines or re-scope intelligently
7. **Effort-to-impact visualization** - If I cut scope by 20%, what's the real effect on user value or deadlines?
8. **Cross-team dependency view** - Understanding how one feature's delay affects others before deciding what to drop
9. **Confidence scores** - Based on delivery data, showing which features are low-risk vs. high-uncertainty

**Insights:**
- PMs need to translate engineering work into business outcomes for stakeholders
- Trade-off decisions require clear visualization of costs vs. benefits
- Roadmaps must be dynamic, not static documentsâ€”"what-if" planning is crucial

---

#### Perspective 4: QA/Test Engineer

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Clear acceptance criteria per story** - Written in Given-When-Then format so testers know exactly what "done" means
2. **Linked design + code context** - Jump from requirement â†’ Figma â†’ PR â†’ test cases without hunting through tools
3. **Environment awareness** - Visibility into which build, branch, or deployment is being tested, and what changed since last run
4. **Bi-directional linking** - Each bug automatically tied to its originating feature, test case, and Git commit or PR
5. **Impact mapping** - When a bug reopens, instantly see what features are at risk or need regression testing
6. **Smart grouping** - Bugs clustered by area or component, so patterns (e.g., recurring API failures) become visible fast
7. **Continuous sync with development** - Test cases auto-update when requirements or stories change
8. **Automated smoke checks** - Instant feedback after each build to catch blockers before full regression
9. **Parallel test planning view** - Shows what's ready to test, in progress, or blocked, aligned with sprint timelines

**Insights:**
- QA needs complete context to test effectivelyâ€”half the battle is understanding what to test and why
- Bug tracking isn't isolatedâ€”it must connect to features, code, and impact
- Testing bottlenecks can be prevented with better visibility and automation

---

#### Perspective 5: DevOps Engineer

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Unified deployment dashboard** - See which version is running in each environment (dev, staging, prod) with build numbers, commit hashes, deploy times
2. **Live pipeline status** - What's building, pending, or failed, and why, across all repos
3. **Environment drift detection** - Alerts if configs, secrets, or dependencies differ between staging and production
4. **Automatic context linking** - Every failed pipeline or incident tied to its related commit, PR, and feature ticket
5. **Root cause timeline** - Visualize when things broke: deploy â†’ error spike â†’ rollback, to accelerate postmortems
6. **Smart notifications** - Only alert the right people (e.g., service owners), with logs and metrics inline, not just "build failed"
7. **Self-healing suggestions** - E.g., "Re-run with cache cleared" or "This failure matches pattern X from previous build"
8. **Auto rollback triggers** - Deploys revert automatically if health checks fail beyond a threshold
9. **Release summary bot** - Posts summaries to Slack/Teams after each deployment (build version, duration, changes, tests passed)

**Insights:**
- DevOps engineers are firefightersâ€”they need fast, contextual information to resolve issues
- Environment management is complex; drift detection and unified views prevent production surprises
- Smart automation (self-healing, auto-rollback) reduces on-call burden and speeds recovery

---

#### Perspective 6: New Team Member

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Interactive project overview** - Visual map showing how features, repos, and services connect (understand architecture fast)
2. **"Start here" onboarding flow** - Tasks, documentation, and sample issues tailored to role, not just a wiki dump
3. **Mentor/bot-assisted Q&A** - Ask "what does this service do?" and instantly get context
4. **Context-rich boards** - Every card links to the goal it supports (OKR, epic, feature)â€”see not just what, but why
5. **Recent activity timeline** - Catch up on key discussions, merges, and decisions without reading every message
6. **Story summaries** - "TL;DR" view of each epic to grasp project priorities at a glance
7. **Transparent progress and ownership** - See who's working on what and where to help, without feeling lost
8. **Built-in walkthroughs** - Clickable guides through boards, pipelines, repos (like an interactive tour)
9. **Positive feedback loops** - Small wins early (e.g., finishing setup checklist, fixing low-risk issue) to feel productive fast

**Insights:**
- Onboarding friction directly impacts time-to-productivity
- Context (the "why") is as important as task lists (the "what")
- Psychological safety mattersâ€”reducing intimidation through transparent, guided experiences

   - Transformative potential: Dramatically reduces onboarding time; democratizes knowledge; reduces burden on senior engineers
   - Challenges to overcome: Training on proprietary codebases, accuracy of responses, avoiding hallucinations, maintaining up-to-date knowledge

5. **Predictive Burnout Detection & Team Health Dashboard**
   - Description: Analyze activity patterns (commit times, context switches, blocked time, overtime) to surface early burnout signals and suggest workload rebalancing
   - Transformative potential: Proactive team health management; reduces attrition; improves long-term productivity
   - Challenges to overcome: Privacy concerns, avoiding surveillance perception, defining healthy vs. unhealthy patterns, cultural sensitivity

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **Root motivation matters more than features:** The app's purpose isn't "better Kanban"â€”it's "prevent wasted developer time." This lens should guide every design decision.

- **Context is the killer capability:** Linking tasks to code, bugs to features, decisions to outcomes eliminates the constant "why did we do this?" question. Context preservation is the moat.

- **Different roles need different views of the same data:** Developers want speed and simplicity; managers want visibility and planning tools; PMs want outcome tracking. Multi-view isn't a luxuryâ€”it's how you serve diverse stakeholders.

- **Trust requires bidirectional sync:** If the board doesn't reflect Git reality (or vice versa), users won't trust it. Git-native integration isn't a featureâ€”it's the foundation.

- **Automation should eliminate ceremony, not control:** Developers rejected AI task suggestions but loved automation that removes busy work (branch creation, PR setup). Automate the boring, not the thinking.

- **Onboarding is a competitive advantage:** New team member experience is often neglected. Making onboarding seamless and context-rich can be a major differentiator in team adoption.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Build Multi-View MVP (Kanban + Timeline + Calendar)

- **Rationale:** Foundation for the entire app; validates core hypothesis that view-switching reveals insights; de-risks UI complexity early
- **Next steps:**
  1. Design shared data model supporting all three views
  2. Wireframe view transitions and filter persistence
  3. Select component libraries (React-DnD for Kanban, Timeline library, FullCalendar)
  4. Build basic CRUD in Kanban view first, then expand to Timeline/Calendar
- **Resources needed:** 1 senior frontend engineer, 1 UI/UX designer, FastAPI backend support for data API
- **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks for functional MVP with basic filtering

#### #2 Priority: Design & Prototype Git-Native Integration ("Move a Card, Ship the Code")

- **Rationale:** This is the killer feature that differentiates from Trello; validating technical feasibility early is critical; this addresses the root "wasted time" problem identified in Five Whys
- **Next steps:**
  1. Research GitHub/GitLab API capabilities (branch creation, PR templates, webhooks)
  2. Define workflows: which card movements trigger which Git actions
  3. Build proof-of-concept: drag card â†’ create branch â†’ link card to PR
  4. Test bidirectional sync: commit â†’ update card status
  5. Design error handling for failed Git operations
- **Resources needed:** 1 backend engineer with Git API experience, 1 DevOps engineer for CI/CD integration, security review for token management
- **Timeline:** 8-10 weeks for working prototype with basic sync

#### #3 Priority: User Research & Validation with Target Developers

- **Rationale:** Before building too much, validate assumptions with real development teams; iterate on workflows, UI, and priorities based on feedback
- **Next steps:**
  1. Recruit 5-10 software teams using Trello, Jira, or Linear today
  2. Conduct interviews: pain points, workflow walkthroughs, feature prioritization
  3. Show mockups of multi-view system and Git integration
  4. Run usability tests on early MVP
  5. Synthesize findings into product roadmap adjustments
- **Resources needed:** Product manager or UX researcher, access to developer communities (dev.to, Reddit, Twitter), incentive budget for participants
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks (parallel with development)

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- **Broad exploration approach** generated ideas across features, architecture, UX, and positioning
- **Five Whys** clarified the "why" behind the app, preventing feature bloat and ensuring focus on core value
- **Role Playing** revealed diverse stakeholder needs that would've been missed with single-perspective brainstorming
- **Iterative questioning** helped refine vague ideas into specific, actionable features
- **Building on momentum** - ideas in later techniques referenced and built on earlier insights

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Technical architecture deep-dive:** How to handle real-time sync at scale? WebSockets vs. polling? Event-driven architecture?
- **Data model design:** Schema for cards, boards, projects, users, Git entities, metadataâ€”with PostgreSQL optimization
- **Docker environment setup:** Multi-container architecture (FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Redis for caching?), development vs. production configs
- **Authentication & permissions:** Role-based access control (RBAC), GitHub OAuth, team/organization hierarchies
- **Pricing & business model:** Open-source vs. SaaS? Freemium tiers? Enterprise features?
- **Competitive analysis:** What can we learn from Linear, Height, Shortcut, and other dev-focused PM tools?
- **API design:** RESTful endpoints, GraphQL consideration, webhooks for external integrations

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Morphological Analysis:** Systematically explore combinations of features (e.g., view types Ã— Git actions Ã— notification triggers) to ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Assumption Reversal:** Challenge core assumptions (e.g., "What if boards DON'T need Git integration?" or "What if we target non-developers first?") to stress-test the vision
- **SCAMPER Method:** Apply to existing project management tools (Substitute Trello's simplicity + Git power; Combine Kanban + IDEs; Eliminate manual status updates; Reverse the boardâ†’Git relationship) to generate more differentiators

### Questions That Emerged
- How do we handle teams using multiple Git platforms (GitHub + GitLab + Bitbucket simultaneously)?
- What's the onboarding flow for connecting a board to a repo? One-to-one or many-to-many relationships?
- Should cards support partial completion tracking (e.g., "3 of 5 acceptance criteria met")?
- How do we visualize dependencies in Kanban view without cluttering the board?
- What happens if a card is moved but the Git operation fails (branch creation denied, no repo access)?
- Should the app support non-Git workflows for teams not using version control?
- How do we handle monorepo vs. microservices architectures differently?
- What's the migration path for teams already using Trello or Jira?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:**
  1. Technical architecture and data modeling workshop
  2. Competitive analysis and market positioning
  3. Go-to-market strategy and user acquisition
  4. Detailed user story mapping for MVP features
- **Recommended timeframe:** 1-2 weeks after user research begins (so findings can inform next session)
- **Preparation needed:**
  - Set up repository and initial Docker environment
  - Research Git APIs (GitHub, GitLab) and document capabilities/limitations
  - Draft database schema for review
  - Create clickable prototype or wireframes for user testing
