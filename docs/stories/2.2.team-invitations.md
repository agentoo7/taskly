# Story 2.2: Team Member Invitations & Permissions

## Status
Ready for Development

---

## Story

**As a** workspace admin,
**I want** to invite team members via email and manage their permissions,
**so that** my team can collaborate on boards.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Workspace settings page displays "Invite Members" button (visible to admins only)
2. Clicking button opens invite modal with email input field (supports multiple comma-separated emails)
3. Role selector dropdown offers two options: "Member" (default), "Admin"
4. Submitting invitation sends email to each address with invite link containing secure token
5. Email template includes: workspace name, inviter's name/avatar, "Join Workspace" CTA button, expiration notice (7 days)
6. Invite link redirects to Taskly; if recipient not logged in, prompts GitHub OAuth first, then accepts invite
7. Accepting invite adds user to workspace_members table with specified role and redirects to workspace dashboard
8. Workspace settings displays member list with columns: avatar, username, email, role, "Remove" button (for admins)
9. Admins can change member roles via dropdown in member list (member ↔ admin)
10. Admins can remove members from workspace (requires confirmation: "Remove [username] from workspace?")
11. Removed members lose access immediately; attempting to access workspace shows 403 error with message "You are no longer a member of this workspace"
12. Invite tokens expire after 7 days; expired links show error message "Invite expired. Please request a new invitation."
13. Members (non-admin role) can view workspace and boards but cannot invite others, change permissions, or delete workspace
14. If authenticated user's email doesn't match invitation email, show error message: "This invitation was sent to {invitation.email}. Your account uses {user.email}." with option to sign out
15. System prevents sending more than 50 invitations per workspace per hour, and max 10 emails per request
16. System prevents last admin from changing their own role to member or removing themselves; shows error: "You are the only admin. Promote another member first."
17. System automatically deletes expired unaccepted invitations after 30 days retention period
18. Admins can resend pending invitations, which generates new token and sends new email
19. Workspace members receive real-time notification when new member joins workspace
20. Member list supports pagination (50 per page) and search by name/email
21. System tracks email delivery status (pending, sent, delivered, failed, bounced) for monitoring and troubleshooting
22. System maintains audit log of all invitation actions (created, accepted, revoked, resent, expired) with timestamps and actor information

### Testing

**Integration Test - Invitation Flow:**
```python
# backend/tests/integration/test_invitations.py
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_and_accept_invitation(client, test_workspace, admin_user, test_user):
    # Admin creates invitation
    response = await client.post(
        f"/workspaces/{test_workspace.id}/invitations",
        json={"emails": ["newuser@example.com"], "role": "member"},
        headers=auth_headers(admin_user)
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    data = response.json()
    token = data[0]["token"]

    # Accept invitation
    response = await client.post(
        f"/invitations/{token}/accept",
        headers=auth_headers(test_user)
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # Verify membership
    response = await client.get(

**Review Type:** Story Quality Assessment (Pre-Development)

---

### Executive Summary

**Overall Story Quality:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 - Good, with improvements needed)

This story provides a comprehensive and well-structured plan for implementing team invitations. The acceptance criteria are clear, task breakdown is logical, and technical design is sound. However, several critical security considerations, edge cases, and implementation details need to be addressed before development begins.

✅ **Security Fundamentals**
- Secure token generation (32 bytes, URL-safe)
- 7-day expiration on invitations
- Role-based access control (admin-only actions)
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate active invitations

✅ **User Experience**
- Clear email templates with branding
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Helpful error messages for expired/invalid invitations

✅ **Technical Architecture**
- Proper async/await patterns
- Service layer separation
- Background job processing with Celery
- Type hints and Pydantic validation

### Critical Issues - Must Fix Before Development

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-1: Email-to-Account Mismatch Handling (AC 6, 7)

**Issue:** AC6 states "if recipient not logged in, prompts GitHub OAuth first, then accepts invite" but doesn't specify what happens when the authenticated user's email doesn't match the invitation email.

**Scenario:**
- Alice invites `bob@company.com` to workspace
- Bob logs in with GitHub account linked to `bob.personal@gmail.com`
- What happens when Bob tries to accept the invitation?

**Current Code Problem (line 295-299):**
```python
user = await self.db.get(User, user_id)
if user.email.lower() != invitation.email.lower():
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=403,
        detail="This invitation is for a different email address"
    )
```

**Recommendation:**
Add to **Task 7** (Acceptance Page):
- Display clear message: "This invitation was sent to {invitation.email}. Your GitHub account uses {user.email}. Please log in with the correct account or contact the workspace admin."
- Add AC 14: "If authenticated user's email doesn't match invitation email, show error with option to log out and try different account"
- Consider allowing admins to invite by GitHub username instead of (or in addition to) email

**Impact:** High - Will cause user confusion and failed invitation acceptances

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-2: Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention (AC 2, 4)

**Issue:** No mention of rate limiting or abuse prevention for invitation endpoints.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Invite bombing: Admin invites 1000s of fake emails, triggering spam emails
- Email enumeration: Attacker uses invite API to discover which emails are already workspace members
- Celery queue flooding: Malicious invitations overwhelm email sending queue

**Recommendation:**
Add to **Task 2** (API Endpoints):
- Implement rate limiting: Max 50 invitations per workspace per hour
- Add to AC 15: "System prevents sending more than 50 invitations per workspace per hour"
- Add validation: Max 10 emails per single invite request
- Add Celery retry strategy with exponential backoff for email failures

**Code Addition for Task 2:**
```python
from slowapi import Limiter
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)

@router.post("/workspaces/{id}/invitations")
@limiter.limit("50/hour")  # Per IP/workspace
async def create_invitations(...):
    if len(emails) > 10:
        raise HTTPException(400, "Maximum 10 emails per request")
```

**Impact:** Critical - Prevents abuse and protects email reputation

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-3: Last Admin Protection (AC 9, 10)

**Issue:** Task 9 prevents admin from removing themselves, but doesn't prevent admin from changing their own role to member, which could leave workspace with zero admins.

**Scenario:**
- Workspace has 1 admin
- Admin changes their role to "member" via dropdown
- Workspace now has zero admins - no one can manage it

**Recommendation:**
Add to **Task 9** (Role Change):
- Check if user is last admin before allowing role change
- Add AC 16: "System prevents last admin from changing their role to member"
- Show error: "You are the only admin. Promote another member to admin first."

**Code Addition:**
```python
# Check if user is last admin
admin_count = await self.db.execute(
    select(func.count(WorkspaceMember.id))
    .where(
        WorkspaceMember.workspace_id == workspace_id,
        WorkspaceMember.role == RoleEnum.ADMIN
    )
)
if admin_count.scalar() == 1 and current_role == RoleEnum.ADMIN:
    raise HTTPException(400, "Cannot remove last admin")
```

**Impact:** Critical - Prevents workspace from becoming unmanageable

---

#### 🟡 HIGH-4: Missing Database Indexes

**Issue:** Model definition lacks indexes for frequently queried fields.

**Performance Problem:**
- Searching invitations by token (line 280): No index on `token` column (has unique constraint, which creates index ✓)
- Searching invitations by workspace + email (line 245-251): No composite index
- Searching invitations by workspace_id for pending list: No index

**Recommendation:**
Add to **Task 1** (Data Models):
```python
__table_args__ = (
    UniqueConstraint('workspace_id', 'email', name='uq_workspace_email_invitation'),
    Index('ix_workspace_invitations_workspace_id', 'workspace_id'),
    Index('ix_workspace_invitations_email', 'email'),
    Index('ix_workspace_invitations_expires_at', 'expires_at'),  # For cleanup job
)
```

**Impact:** High - Query performance degrades with scale

---

#### 🟡 HIGH-5: Missing Cleanup Job for Expired Invitations

**Issue:** Expired invitations remain in database indefinitely, bloating the table.

**Recommendation:**
Add **Task 14: Create expired invitation cleanup job**
- Create Celery periodic task (runs daily)
- Delete invitations where `expires_at < now() AND accepted_at IS NULL`
- Add to AC 17: "System automatically deletes expired unaccepted invitations after 30 days"

**Code:**
```python
# backend/app/tasks/cleanup_invitations.py
from celery import shared_task
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@shared_task
def cleanup_expired_invitations():
    """Delete invitations expired > 30 days ago."""
    cutoff = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=30)
    deleted = await db.execute(
        delete(WorkspaceInvitation)
        .where(
            WorkspaceInvitation.expires_at < cutoff,
            WorkspaceInvitation.accepted_at.is_(None)
        )
    )
    return deleted.rowcount
```

**Impact:** High - Database bloat over time

---

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 🟠 MEDIUM-6: Missing Resend Invitation Feature (UX)

**Issue:** No way to resend invitation if email wasn't received.

**Recommendation:**
Add to **Task 12** (Pending Invitations List):
- Add "Resend" button next to each pending invitation
- Clicking generates new token and sends new email
- Add AC 18: "Admins can resend pending invitations, generating new token and email"

---

#### 🟠 MEDIUM-7: No Notification When New Member Joins (UX)

**Issue:** Existing workspace members aren't notified when someone accepts an invitation.

**Recommendation:**
Add to **Task 7** (Acceptance Page):
- After successful acceptance, broadcast WebSocket event: `member_joined`
- Show toast notification to other online members: "{username} joined the workspace"
- Add AC 19: "Workspace members receive real-time notification when new member joins"

---

#### 🟠 MEDIUM-8: Missing Audit Trail

**Issue:** No audit log for invitation actions (created, accepted, revoked, expired).

**Recommendation:**
Consider adding to future story:
- Create `workspace_audit_log` table
- Log all permission changes, invitations, removals
- Useful for compliance and debugging

---

#### 🟠 MEDIUM-9: Email Provider Configuration Incomplete (Task 4)

**Issue:** Task 4 says "Configure email provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, or SMTP for development)" but provides no specific implementation.

**Recommendation:**
Add to **Task 4**:
- Specify which provider to use (recommend SendGrid for ease of setup)
- Document required environment variables:
  - `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
  - `FROM_EMAIL`
  - `FROM_NAME`
- Add email delivery status tracking (bounces, failures)
- For development, use Mailhog (local SMTP server) or log to console

---

#### 🟠 MEDIUM-10: Pagination Missing for Member List (AC 8)

**Issue:** Member list has no pagination - could cause performance issues with large teams.

**Recommendation:**
Add to **Task 8** (Member List):
- Add pagination to `GET /workspaces/{id}/members` endpoint
- Default page size: 50 members
- Add search/filter by name or email
- Add AC 20: "Member list supports pagination (50 per page) and search by name/email"

---

### Edge Cases to Address

#### Missing Scenarios:

1. **Inviting Already-Removed Member**
   - User was member, got removed, now being re-invited
   - Should this be allowed? (Recommendation: Yes, with audit log)

2. **Concurrent Invitation Acceptance**
   - Two users try to accept same invitation simultaneously
   - Current code may fail due to race condition
   - Fix: Add database transaction isolation level

3. **Workspace Deleted While Invitation Pending**
   - Invitation token exists but workspace deleted
   - Current code will fail on acceptance (foreign key constraint)
   - Fix: CASCADE delete on workspace_invitations.workspace_id (line 171 - already handled ✓)

4. **User Changes Email After Invitation Sent**
   - User invited at `old@email.com`
   - User changes GitHub email to `new@email.com`
   - Invitation now invalid
   - Fix: Document as known limitation, suggest resend invitation

5. **Multiple Pending Invitations for Same Email**
   - Unique constraint prevents this (line 185-187) ✓
   - But what if first invitation expires? Can second be sent?
   - Recommendation: Allow new invitation if previous one expired

---

### Test Coverage Assessment

#### ✅ Well-Covered Areas:
- Task 13 includes comprehensive test list
- Integration tests for core flows
- Permission checks
- Expiration validation

#### ❌ Missing Test Cases:

**Add to Task 13:**

```python
# Security Tests
- Test: Non-admin cannot create invitations (403 error)
- Test: User cannot accept invitation for different email address
- Test: Rate limiting blocks excessive invitations (>50/hour)
- Test: Token must be exactly 64 chars URL-safe

# Edge Case Tests
- Test: Accept invitation with expired token returns 400
- Test: Accept already-accepted invitation returns 400
- Test: Cannot invite user who is already member (skips silently)
- Test: Cannot change last admin role to member
- Test: Cannot remove self as member
- Test: Deleting workspace cascades to pending invitations

# Email Tests
- Test: Email sent contains correct workspace name and inviter info
- Test: Email retry logic on send failure
- Test: Email not sent if Celery task fails gracefully

# WebSocket Tests
- Test: member_role_changed event broadcast on role change
- Test: member_removed event broadcast on removal
- Test: Frontend invalidates cache on WebSocket events

# Performance Tests
- Test: Member list pagination works correctly
- Test: Inviting 10 emails creates 10 invitations atomically
```

### Coding Standards Compliance

#### ✅ Compliant:
- Async/await used correctly throughout
- Type hints present in all function signatures
- Pydantic schemas for API responses
- Transaction wrapping for multi-step operations (create_invitations)
- Proper error handling with HTTPException

#### ⚠️ Needs Attention:

1. **Missing Correlation IDs** (Standard #7)
   - Add correlation ID logging to invitation service
   ```python
   import structlog
   logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)

   async def create_invitations(...):
       logger.info("Creating invitations",
                   workspace_id=str(workspace_id),
                   email_count=len(emails))
   ```

2. **Missing Timeout on Email Sending** (Standard #5)
   - Celery task should have timeout
   ```python
   @shared_task(time_limit=30)  # 30 second timeout
   def send_invitation_email_task(invitation_id: str):
   ```

3. **WebSocket Broadcasts Need Timestamps** (Standard #10)
   ```python
   await manager.broadcast_to_workspace(
       workspace_id,
       {
           "type": "member_role_changed",
           "data": {...},
           "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()  # Add this
       }
   )
   ```

4. **Missing Import in Model** (Line 176)
   - `func` is used but not imported
   - Add: `from sqlalchemy import func`

---

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **Email Provider Abstraction**
   - Hardcoding email provider in Celery task
   - Recommendation: Create `EmailService` interface to swap providers easily

2. **No Email Delivery Tracking**
   - Can't tell if emails were delivered, bounced, or failed
   - Recommendation: Add `delivery_status` field to WorkspaceInvitation model

3. **Invitation Analytics Missing**
   - No tracking of acceptance rate, time-to-accept, etc.
   - Recommendation: Add to future analytics story

---

### Recommendations Summary

#### Must Fix Before Development (P0):
1. ✅ Add email-to-account mismatch handling (AC 14)
2. ✅ Implement rate limiting (AC 15)
3. ✅ Protect last admin from role changes (AC 16)
4. ✅ Add database indexes to invitation model
5. ✅ Create expired invitation cleanup job (Task 14, AC 17)
6. ✅ Fix missing imports in model code
7. ✅ Add WebSocket timestamps
8. ✅ Add Celery task timeout
9. ✅ Add missing test cases for security and edge cases

#### Should Fix (P1):
10. Add resend invitation feature (AC 18)
11. Add member join notifications (AC 19)
12. Add member list pagination (AC 20)
13. Specify email provider configuration details
14. Add correlation ID logging

#### Nice to Have (P2):
15. Email delivery tracking
16. Audit log for invitation actions
17. Invitation analytics

---

### Updated Acceptance Criteria

The story should add these acceptance criteria:

**AC 14:** If authenticated user's email doesn't match invitation email, show error message: "This invitation was sent to {invitation.email}. Your account uses {user.email}." with option to sign out

**AC 15:** System prevents sending more than 50 invitations per workspace per hour, and max 10 emails per request

**AC 16:** System prevents last admin from changing their own role to member or removing themselves; shows error: "You are the only admin. Promote another member first."

**AC 17:** System automatically deletes expired unaccepted invitations after 30 days retention period

**AC 18:** Admins can resend pending invitations, which generates new token and sends new email

**AC 19:** Workspace members receive real-time notification when new member joins workspace

**AC 20:** Member list supports pagination (50 per page) and search by name/email

---

### Final Verdict

**Story Quality Score: 82/100**

**Breakdown:**
- Requirements Clarity: 18/20 (missing email mismatch scenario)
- Task Breakdown: 18/20 (missing cleanup job, resend feature)
- Technical Design: 16/20 (missing rate limiting, indexes, last admin protection)
- Test Coverage: 15/20 (missing security and edge case tests)
- Security Considerations: 15/20 (missing rate limiting, some edge cases)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **APPROVE WITH CHANGES**

This is a well-structured story with solid technical design. Address the 9 P0 critical issues above before starting development, and consider the P1 improvements for better production readiness.

**Next Steps:**
1. Development team reviews and addresses P0 issues
2. Product owner approves additional acceptance criteria (AC 14-20)
3. Update story file with changes
4. Begin development with confidence

---

**Questions for Product Owner:**

1. Which email provider should we use? (SendGrid, AWS SES, or other?)
2. What is acceptable member limit per workspace? (affects pagination strategy)
3. Should we allow re-inviting previously removed members?
4. Do we need invitation analytics/reporting?

---

**Estimated Story Complexity:** **13 story points** → **15 story points** (after adding cleanup job and security improvements)

**Risk Level:** **Medium** → **Low** (after addressing critical issues)

Ready to proceed to development after addressing P0 issues above.
